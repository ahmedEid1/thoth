# Thoth

**Agentic systematic literature reviews — with every citation checked against the source.**

*Named for Thoth, ancient Egypt's ibis-headed god of writing and scribes.*

## What is Thoth?

Systematic literature reviews are slow to write — and when you ask an LLM to write
one, it confidently invents citations and statistics that aren't in any paper.

**Thoth does both halves and checks its own work.** Give it a research question and
it discovers relevant papers, reads them, drafts an evidence-grounded review — then
runs a verification pass (`cite_check`) that compares **every cited claim against the
source paper** and flags anything unsupported *before you read the draft*. The result
is a review with a critic score, a citation-faithfulness percentage, and a per-claim
audit you can trust.

It runs as a polished web app, a public eval dashboard, and an authenticated MCP
server your AI assistant can call directly.

## See it work

**Claude.ai catches 6 fabricated citations in a real draft — using Thoth's audit:**

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/assets/m5-mcp-demo.gif" alt="Claude.ai connected to Thoth via MCP, using get_citation_audit to identify 6 unsupported claims" width="760" />
</div>

> Connected to Thoth via the [official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=thoth), Claude calls `get_citation_audit`, finds a review with faithfulness 0.13, and identifies all 6 unsupported claims — every one citing the same paper, with invented percentages that aren't in the source.

**Every claim, scored against its source** — the `/showcase` review (no login needed):

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/assets/media/02-showcase.png" alt="A completed Thoth review: critic 4.2/5, citation faithfulness 75%, 8/8 citations checked with 2 unsupported" width="760" />
</div>

## Key features

- **🔎 `cite_check` — verifiable citations.** Every `[paper_id]` in the draft is
  checked against the cited paper and labelled supported / unsupported / unclear.
  This is the core differentiator: the LLM can't quietly hallucinate a citation.
- **🌐 Outbound web search (v2).** Point Thoth at a question and its
  `discoverer → fetcher → screener` agents find papers across **OpenAlex**, **arXiv**,
  and **Exa**, fetch the open-access PDFs, OCR them, and screen each against your plan
  — no manual uploads required. (Or stay in uploaded-only, or hybrid.)
- **🔌 Authenticated, registered MCP server.** OAuth 2.1 + PKCE + Dynamic Client
  Registration via Clerk, SHA-256 audit logging, rate limits — listed in the
  [official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=thoth).
  Most public MCP servers ship with no auth; this one doesn't.
- **📊 Public eval dashboard.** Recall / precision / faithfulness / coverage over a
  versioned golden set, refreshed weekly by CI and rendered at
  [`/evals`](https://thoth-slr.vercel.app/evals) — an eval regression is a *public*
  signal, not a hidden one.
- **💸 6 LLM providers, $0 by default.** Swap providers with one env var; the Mistral
  free tier runs the whole thing, and the entire stack deploys on free tiers for
  **$0/month**.

## 🚀 Quickstart

**Try it now (nothing to install):**

**Run it locally:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedEid1/thoth.git && cd thoth
cp .env.example .env        # Clerk + Trigger.dev keys + MISTRAL_API_KEY
docker compose up -d        # postgres, minio, langfuse
pnpm install && pnpm prisma migrate dev
pnpm dev                    # Next.js on :3000
pnpm dev:trigger            # Trigger.dev worker (separate terminal)
```
