# Thoth v2 build roadmap

Per-milestone shipping log for V2 outbound search. The full spec is at
[`docs/superpowers/specs/thoth-v2-design.md`](../specs/thoth-v2-design.md);
V1's milestone log is at [`thoth-roadmap.md`](./thoth-roadmap.md).

Each milestone landed as a series of small commits on master with the
`v2-m{0..4}{a..d}` prefix on commit messages. Vercel auto-deployed every
push and the additive Prisma migrations ran on Neon at build time — V1
projects continue to route through the uploaded-only path unchanged.

## V2-M0 — Schema + adapter scaffolding

**Goal:** Lay down the data model + provider-interface contract without
touching the agent.

**What shipped:**

- Spec doc at `docs/superpowers/specs/thoth-v2-design.md`.
- Prisma migration `20260527190000_add_v2_outbound_search`:
  enum `SearchScope` (uploaded_only / outbound / hybrid); `Project`
  gains searchScope + searchProviders + year-range + skipDiscoveryGate
  (all defaulted to V1-equivalent values); `CorpusItem` gains optional
  `externalDoi` + `externalArxivId` cross-references; new tables
  `DiscoveredPaper` + `ScreeningDecision`.
- `lib/search/types.ts` + stubbed adapters under `lib/search/providers/`
  for OpenAlex / arXiv / Exa, plus the `dispatchSearch` fan-out with
  per-provider error isolation + score-max dedup.

**Key files:** `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/migrations/20260527190000_add_v2_outbound_search/`, `lib/search/{types,dispatch}.ts`, `lib/search/providers/{openalex,arxiv,exa}.ts`

## V2-M1 — Real adapters + agent nodes

**Goal:** Make the outbound pipeline runnable end-to-end behind a feature
toggle.

**What shipped (m1a-m1d):**

- **OpenAlex** adapter — `lib/search/providers/openalex.ts` with abstract
  rebuild from the inverted index, year-range filtering via the
  documented `from_publication_date` / `to_publication_date` filters,
  DOI-first canonical externalId for cross-provider dedup, BM25-score
  normalization into [0,1].
- **arXiv** adapter — regex-based Atom XML parser (`parseArxivAtom`
  exported for unit tests), version-suffix normalization so `v1`/`v2`/`v3`
  of the same preprint dedup, DOI cross-reference when arXiv exposes one,
  always-OA accessStatus.
- **discoverer** node + `lib/prompts/discover-queries.ts` — smart-tier
  LLM call producing 4-8 natural-language queries + rationale; universal
  prompt (per-adapter translation) per spec §13.1; fan-out across
  providers via `dispatchSearch`; bulk persist via
  `createMany({ skipDuplicates: true })` for idempotency.
- **fetcher** node — bounded-concurrency-8 HEAD + GET + R2 upload +
  Mistral OCR + CorpusItem create; non-fatal skip for paywalled / 4xx /
  non-PDF / oversized; cross-reference cols populated.
- **screener** node + `lib/prompts/screen-paper.ts` — per-paper include
  / exclude verdict with relevanceScore + reason; persists
  `ScreeningDecision` rows; materializes `IncludedPaper` for the V1
  assessor when include=true AND the fetcher succeeded (so the assessor
  doesn't trip on null parsedMarkdown).
- **graph rewiring** — new conditional edge after `plan_gate`:
  `outbound`/`hybrid` projects route to `discoverer → discovery_gate →
  fetcher → screener → papers_gate`; `uploaded_only` keeps V1's
  `retriever → papers_gate` path. New `APPROVE_DISCOVERY` interrupt kind.
- **enum migration** `20260527200000_v2_status_and_checkpoint_kinds` —
  RunStatus += DISCOVERING / AWAITING_DISCOVERY_APPROVAL / FETCHING /
  SCREENING; CheckpointKind += APPROVE_DISCOVERY.
- **trigger task** — initial-state hydration now reads `project.searchScope`
  + `searchProviders`; setRunStatus branches APPROVE_DISCOVERY →
  AWAITING_DISCOVERY_APPROVAL.

**Key files:** `lib/agent/nodes/{discoverer,fetcher,screener}.ts`, `lib/agent/graph.ts`, `lib/agent/state.ts`, `lib/agent/runs.ts`, `trigger/run-review.ts`, `prisma/migrations/20260527200000_v2_status_and_checkpoint_kinds/`

## V2-M2 — Exa, UI, kill switch

**Goal:** Round out provider set + give users a way to actually use V2 +
operator panic-button.

**What shipped (m2a-m2d):**

- **Exa** adapter (`lib/search/providers/exa.ts`) — POST to
  `api.exa.ai/search` with semantic (`type: "neural"`) mode + bundled
  `contents.text` (free per-request pricing), x-api-key auth,
  startPublishedDate / endPublishedDate filters, PDF-URL detection for
  accessStatus.
- **SEARCH_DISABLED** kill switch in `lib/env.ts` — the discoverer node
  refuses to fan out when set to "1" (operator panic button pattern,
  same as DEMO_DISABLED).
- **EXA_API_KEY** env knob — Exa adapter throws SearchProviderError
  "missing API key" when unset; dispatcher records per-provider so other
  providers still contribute.
- **DiscoveryApprovalCard** (`components/runs/discovery-approval-card.tsx`)
  — client component renders queries + the deduped hit list with
  per-row keep/drop checkbox + reject-with-reason. Plugged into the
  run-detail page when an APPROVE_DISCOVERY checkpoint is PENDING.
- **NewProjectDialog** picks searchScope (uploaded_only / outbound /
  hybrid) + searchProviders. POST /api/projects accepts the new fields
  with safe defaults (outbound-without-providers coerces to
  ["openalex", "arxiv"]).
- **runs-start guard** relaxed: outbound mode skips the
  "≥1 PARSED corpus item" check (the discoverer builds the corpus
  itself); hybrid still requires uploads; both modes require ≥1
  search provider.

**Key files:** `lib/search/providers/exa.ts`, `lib/env.ts`, `lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.ts`, `components/runs/discovery-approval-card.tsx`, `components/projects/new-project-dialog.tsx`, `app/api/projects/route.ts`, `app/api/projects/[id]/runs/route.ts`

## V2-M3 — Eval metrics + schema field

**Goal:** Give the public `/evals` dashboard the same first-class
treatment for V2 nodes that V1 nodes get.

**What shipped:**

- `discoveryRecall(expected, discovered)` + `screeningPrecision(expected,
  admitted)` in `lib/eval/metrics.ts`, both honouring the existing
  vacuous-true convention.
- `expectedDois?: string[]` optional field added to
  `GoldenQuestionSchema` — existing v1 goldens stay valid (the field
  defaults to undefined → discoveryRecall returns 1 vacuously).

**Not yet shipped:** v2-mode golden YAMLs (with real arXiv DOIs) and the
EVAL_MODE=outbound CI path. These need careful research input from the
maintainer to pick goldens with verifiable arXiv IDs that aren't trivial
to surface. The framework is ready to consume them as soon as they land.

**Key files:** `lib/eval/metrics.ts`, `lib/eval/golden-schema.ts`

## V2-M115 — Honor the project's publication-year filter (declared-but-dead bug)

**Goal:** Fix a genuine end-to-end gap found during a fresh audit. The
search-tuning surface (M8) added a publication-year range to the create +
edit dialogs; `Project.searchYearStart` / `searchYearEnd` are validated,
persisted, AND displayed on the project page — but the value never reached
the search. The discoverer hardcoded `yearStart: undefined, yearEnd:
undefined` in its `dispatchSearch` call, so the user's year filter was
silently ignored. Same class of bug as M14/M15 ("declared, never honored").

**What shipped:**

- `lib/agent/state.ts`: `AgentState` gains `searchYearStart` / `searchYearEnd`
  (both `number | null`, mirroring `searchMaxHits`).
- `trigger/run-review.ts`: the project select + initial-state hydration now
  carry the year range into the run.
- `lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.ts`: the `dispatchSearch` call passes
  `state.searchYearStart ?? undefined` / `searchYearEnd ?? undefined` instead
  of hardcoded `undefined`.

All three providers already implemented the filter (OpenAlex
`from/to_publication_date`, Exa `start/endPublishedDate`, arXiv client-side),
so this was purely a plumbing gap — the UI and the adapters were both ready;
only the middle was disconnected.

**Tests:** discoverer (year range reaches every dispatched query; null →
undefined; one-sided bound); trigger (year range hydrated into the initial
agent state). 638 unit/integ green.

**Why this matters:** a tuning control that's collected, persisted, and shown
back to the user but silently ignored is worse than not having it — the user
believes they've scoped the search by year and trusts results that didn't
honor the bound. This makes the M8 control real.

**Key files:** `lib/agent/state.ts`, `trigger/run-review.ts`,
`lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.ts`

## V2-M114 — SearchQuery audit table (the last deferred V2-spec item)

**Goal:** Ship the dedicated `SearchQuery` audit table the original V2 spec
(§10) called for and that v2.0 deferred. Until now the on-disk audit was the
`HumanCheckpoint.proposal` (the final query list a human approved) +
`RunStep.failureReason` (per-provider errors only) — neither captures the
per-call grain: which exact query went to which provider and how many
results came back. M114 closes that gap.

**What shipped:**

- **Schema + migration** (`prisma/schema.prisma`,
  `20260528000000_add_search_query_audit`): new `SearchQuery` model — one row
  per (query × provider) call: `provider`, `query`, `resultCount` (pre-dedup),
  `success`, `error`, `createdAt`, FK to `Run` (cascade). Purely additive;
  validated against a throwaway Postgres (full migration chain applies clean,
  table shape matches the model, zero drift introduced).
- **Dispatcher** (`lib/search/dispatch.ts`): `DispatchResult` gains
  `providerStats` — the PRE-dedup per-provider outcome. Necessary because the
  merged `hits` collapse cross-provider duplicates onto one winning provider,
  so they can't recover per-provider counts. Also upgraded rejection
  attribution: a non-`SearchProviderError` throw is now attributed to the
  provider by its `allSettled` index (was `"unknown"`) — accurate for the
  audit + the existing error log.
- **Discoverer** (`lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.ts`): accumulates an audit row
  per `providerStats` entry across the query loop and writes them in one
  `createMany`. NON-FATAL — the insert is try/caught and the iteration is
  `?? []`-guarded, so an audit failure can never break a run. Re-discovery
  (M113) appends rows rather than deleting them — the table is a complete
  historical trail.
- **MCP surface** (`lib/mcp/tools/get-search-queries.ts`): the
  `get_search_queries` output gains `callAudit` — the chronological per-call
  list. The spec named this tool the audit surface; it's now the queryable
  realization.

**Deliberately not done:** a run-detail UI table for the audit. The run
summary already shows per-provider discovered-paper counts; a second
(pre-dedup) table risks clutter, and the spec framed the value as
queryability (MCP), not a new human surface.

**Tests:** dispatch providerStats (fan-out counts, pre-dedup-not-undercounted,
error attribution); discoverer audit-write (one row per query×provider) +
non-fatal-on-insert-failure; MCP callAudit mapping + empty-for-legacy-runs.

**Why this matters:** outbound mode sends the user's research question to
third parties. A precise, queryable "what was sent to whom, and what came
back" trail is a privacy/audit primitive, not a nicety — it lets a worried
researcher (or an AI assistant via MCP) reconstruct the exact outbound
footprint of a review. This was the last open item from the V2 spec.

**Key files:** `prisma/schema.prisma`,
`prisma/migrations/20260528000000_add_search_query_audit/`,
`lib/search/dispatch.ts`, `lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.ts`,
`lib/mcp/tools/get-search-queries.ts`

## V2-M113 — Discovery re-run: edit queries at the gate, re-run the discoverer

**Goal:** Close the documented v2.x follow-up to the discovery gate. Until
now the gate was approve-or-reject only: if the LLM-generated queries were
off, the user's sole recourse was to reject the whole run and re-plan. The
gate already showed the queries read-only with a comment promising "the
follow-up UI (v2.x) will allow editing queries + re-running the discoverer."
M113 ships that loop.

**What shipped:**

- **Graph** (`lib/agent/graph.ts`): `routeAfterDiscoveryGate` now returns
  `"discoverer"` when the gate decision carries non-empty `editedQueries`
  (checked FIRST — a re-run decision also carries `approved:false`, which
  would otherwise read as a rejection). New `discovery_gate → discoverer`
  conditional edge closes the cycle.
- **Discoverer** (`lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.ts`): a re-discovery branch
  uses the edited queries verbatim (trimmed, blank rows dropped), SKIPS the
  LLM query-generation call, `deleteMany`s the run's prior DiscoveredPapers
  (safe at the gate — the fetcher/screener haven't run, so no CorpusItem /
  ScreeningDecision rows reference them), then re-searches. Clears the
  consumed gate decision (hygiene, not correctness).
- **UI** (`components/runs/discovery-approval-card.tsx`): an "Edit & re-run"
  mode with per-query inputs, add/remove rows, and a "Re-run discovery"
  button that POSTs `{approved:false, editedQueries}` to the existing
  approve endpoint (the route spreads body over `{approved:true}`, so body
  wins — no endpoint change needed).
- **Trigger loop** (`trigger/run-review.ts`): the gate-agnostic segment loop
  already re-fires the discovery_gate with a fresh token/checkpoint. Two
  fixes for the cycle: (1) the `segment < 6` cap silently capped re-runs at
  2 (a 3rd left the run paused → mis-reported FAILED); raised to 16 (safe —
  every segment blocks on a 24h human token, so this bounds patience, not
  cost). (2) The discovery-rejection branch now excludes a re-run decision
  (`approved:false` + `editedQueries`) so it isn't mis-classified REJECTED.
  Run-status display is now phase-based (not segment-index based) so a
  re-run segment shows DISCOVERING, not a drifted FETCHING.
- **Display** (`app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`): the discovery
  summary's query source switched from `.find()` (oldest checkpoint) to
  `.findLast()` (latest) so it shows the edited queries that produced the
  current hit set — restoring consistency with the `get_search_queries` MCP
  tool, which already ordered `createdAt desc`.

**Tests:** graph re-discovery cycle (real graph, mocked nodes, MemorySaver —
asserts the discoverer runs twice then proceeds); discoverer unit tests
(edited-queries path skips LLM + deletes prior set + clears decision; all-
blank edits fall back to LLM); trigger re-run test (two discovery
checkpoints, DISCOVERING shown twice, run still COMPLETED not REJECTED).
630 unit/integration green.

**Why this matters:** the discovery gate is the highest-leverage HITL point
in an outbound run — bad queries waste the entire fetch + screen + assess
budget. Letting the user correct the queries in place (instead of rejecting
+ re-planning the whole run) is the difference between a usable gate and a
ceremonial one.

**Key files:** `lib/agent/graph.ts`, `lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.ts`,
`components/runs/discovery-approval-card.tsx`, `trigger/run-review.ts`,
`app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`

## V2-M61 — Corpus-list polling effect uses stable signature

**Goal:** `CorpusItemList` polls every 2s while any item
is PENDING / PARSING via a `useEffect` whose dependency
array was `[items, router]`. Because `items` is a new
array reference on every server-page render (every 2s
while polling is active), the effect tore down + re-set
the interval on every tick. Behaviour was correct but
the cleanup/re-setup churn was unnecessary.

**What shipped:**

- Effect dependency switched from `items` to a stable
  string signature `items.map(i => i.status).join(",")`
  — only changes when at least one item's status
  actually changes.
- Matches the M42 RefreshTickList pattern (stable
  signature for the same reason).

**Key files:** `components/corpus/corpus-item-list.tsx`

## V2-M112 — Security doc reflects the hardened SSRF defence

**Goal:** `docs/security-and-privacy.md` (the project's
security/GDPR evidence page) claimed "No SSRF surface in
the v2 fetcher" but described the **pre-M110** defence —
listing only the dotted-IPv4 + localhost cases. After
M110/M111 closed real bypasses, the doc was *overstating*
a control that had actually been bypassable: a security
evidence page asserting a stronger guarantee than the
code delivered.

**What shipped:**

- The "SSRF defence" bullet rewritten to accurately list
  the full M110/M111 coverage: IPv6 (loopback /
  unspecified / link-local / unique-local), IPv4-mapped
  IPv6 (incl. Node's hex-group normalization), alt IPv4
  encodings (decimal / hex / octal), the **manual
  redirect re-validation** (the headline M111 fix), and
  the **streamed 25 MB download cap**. Cites the 36
  covering tests.
- Renamed the bullet from "No SSRF surface" to "SSRF
  defence" — honest framing (defence-in-depth, not an
  absolute guarantee).
- Added a **"Known limits"** entry documenting that DNS
  rebinding is out of scope (literal-host check, not
  resolution-time), with the mitigation (egress
  controls) — matches the in-code doc comment.

**Why this matters:** for a security-conscious project,
an evidence page that overstates a defence is worse than
one that's accurate-but-modest. M110/M111 fixed the code;
M112 makes the documented guarantee match reality
(including the honest limit).

**Key files:** `docs/security-and-privacy.md`

## V2-M111 — SSRF-via-redirect + unbounded-download fixes

**Goal:** Continuing the M110 depth-review of the
fetcher's download path surfaced two more real gaps in
`downloadPdf`:

1. **SSRF via redirect (security).** Both the HEAD + GET
   used `redirect: "follow"`. `isSafeExternalUrl` only
   gated the INITIAL url — so a *safe* publisher URL that
   returned `302 Location: http://169.254.169.254/...`
   was followed straight to the metadata service,
   silently bypassing M110's hardening. The up-front
   check is worthless without re-validating each hop.
2. **Unbounded body read (DoS).** `await res.arrayBuffer()`
   buffered the entire response, size-checked only
   afterwards. A server omitting `Content-Length` could
   stream unbounded data (bounded only by the 30s fetch
   timeout) → worker memory exhaustion.

**What shipped:**

- New `safeFetch(url, method)` — manual redirect
  following (`redirect: "manual"`) that re-runs
  `isSafeExternalUrl` on EACH hop (resolving relative
  Locations against the current url), capped at
  `MAX_REDIRECTS = 5`. The SSRF defense now covers the
  whole redirect chain.
- `downloadPdf` streams the GET body via
  `res.body.getReader()` and aborts (`reader.cancel()`)
  the instant the accumulated size exceeds
  `MAX_PDF_BYTES` (25 MB) — no full-buffer-then-check.
- `safeFetch` + `downloadPdf` exported (like
  `isSafeExternalUrl`) for direct unit testing.
- 10 new tests: redirect to internal → null (+ first
  hop only fetched), public redirect chain followed,
  relative-redirect resolution, max-redirect bail,
  missing-Location → null; streamed over-cap (26×1MB,
  no Content-Length) → null, small streamed body
  accepted, HEAD-content-length over cap → null,
  internal URL rejected before any fetch.

**Severity:** the redirect bypass is the same
metadata-credential-theft class as M110 — and was the
*remaining* hole after M110 (which only fixed the
first-URL check). Now closed end-to-end. DNS rebinding
still out of scope (documented).

**Key files:** `lib/agent/nodes/fetcher.ts`, `tests/lib/agent/nodes/fetcher-download.test.ts`

## V2-M110 — SSRF defense hardening (real security gaps closed)

**Goal:** Investigating the V2 fetcher's SSRF defense
(`isSafeExternalUrl`, M33) — which downloads PDFs from
provider-supplied `oaUrl`s and explicitly aims to block
the cloud-metadata service (169.254.169.254 →
credential theft) — found three real bypasses of that
stated protection:

1. **IPv4-mapped IPv6** —
   `http://[::ffff:169.254.169.254]/` reached the
   metadata service; the old check only matched `::1`.
   (Node normalizes it to `::ffff:a9fe:a9fe`, so a
   dotted-decimal regex misses it too.)
2. **IPv6 private ranges** — only `::1` was caught;
   `fe80::/10` link-local + `fc00::/7` unique-local
   weren't.
3. **Alt IPv4 encodings** — bare-decimal
   (`2130706433`), hex (`0x7f000001`), octal-octet
   (`0177.0.0.1`). (Node's URL parser canonicalizes
   these to dotted-decimal, so the dotted check already
   caught them — but the explicit all-numeric-labels
   guard is defense-in-depth for runtimes that don't.)

**What shipped:**

- `isSafeExternalUrl` rewritten with: IPv6 bracket
  stripping; `::1`/`::`/`fe80::`/`fc`/`fd` rejection;
  `embeddedMappedIPv4` (parses BOTH `::ffff:a.b.c.d`
  and Node's hex-group `::ffff:HHHH:HHHH`) → re-checks
  the embedded IPv4; an all-numeric-label IPv4-literal
  guard that only allows a canonical public dotted-quad.
- `isPrivateIPv4` extracted as a shared helper.
- 7 new tests (mapped-IPv6, IPv6 link/unique-local,
  decimal/hex/octal encodings to internal addresses)
  PLUS no-false-positive cases (public dotted-quad,
  public IPv6, public mapped, all-hex-letter domains
  like `cafe.ad`, and octal→public `0250.x` which is
  correctly *allowed*).

**Severity:** defense-in-depth — Vercel/Trigger.dev
egress controls block the practical cases — but the
control's whole job is to stop SSRF-to-metadata, and it
was bypassable. DNS rebinding remains explicitly out of
scope (needs resolution-time checks), documented.

**Found by investigating, not churning:** the core
(cite_check, cite-extract) reviewed clean; this was the
one genuine defect a depth-pass surfaced.

**Key files:** `lib/agent/nodes/fetcher.ts`, `tests/lib/agent/nodes/fetcher-ssrf.test.ts`

## V2-M109 — e2e cleanup hardening: register-for-delete before assertions

**Goal:** While fixing M108 I found a latent cleanup
gap. The afterAll hook only DELETEs project ids in
`createdProjectIds`. The outbound + hybrid create-tests
registered the id *after* their panel assertions — so
when M108's assertion failed mid-test, the project was
created on prod but never registered → orphaned (×2
with live retries).

(Verified prod was actually clean — a `startsWith "E2E
live walkthrough"` sweep found 0 orphans, so the failed
run's projects were either auto-swept or didn't persist
— but the latent leak is real and worth closing.)

**What shipped:**

- Outbound + hybrid create-tests now capture the URL +
  `createdProjectIds.add(projectId)` IMMEDIATELY after
  the project page loads (heading visible), BEFORE the
  Discovery-config-panel assertions. Any later
  assertion failure now still cleans up.
- The first walkthrough test + the full-pipeline create
  tests already registered promptly — verified, left
  unchanged.
- Re-ran the full auth-walkthrough locally (playwright
  auto-starts the dev server, which runs the M108 fix):
  7/7 green, confirming both the regression fix AND the
  reordering.

**Validation method note:** because the Vercel deploy
was throttled (free-tier batching), the definitive
confirmation ran against a LOCAL dev server built from
the fixed code — equivalent to the deploy for test
purposes (same prod Neon backend via `.env`). The live
re-run will pass too once the deploy lands.

**Key files:** `tests/e2e/live-auth-walkthrough.spec.ts`

## V2-M108 — Fix e2e regression: M82 sr-only label collided with config panel

**Goal / the bug:** Running the live auth-walkthrough
e2e against the deploy (end-of-session validation)
caught a real regression M82 introduced. The hybrid-
project test asserts
`getByText(/hybrid \(uploaded \+ outbound\)/i)` to
verify the discovery config panel. M82 had added an
sr-only scope label to the project-detail `h1`
(`" (Hybrid (uploaded + outbound))"`) — duplicating
the scope text that's *also* in the config panel's
`<dd>`. So `getByText` matched 2 elements →
strict-mode violation → fail.

My M105 analysis checked the heading *role* selector
(safe — getByRole does substring on internal role
selectors) but missed that the sr-only text duplicated
a string a *different* `getByText` looked for.

**What shipped:**

- Removed the redundant sr-only scope label from the
  project-detail `h1`. The decorative aria-hidden badge
  stays; the Discovery configuration panel below
  already conveys the scope accessibly, so the heading
  sr-only was pure redundancy (and read awkwardly:
  "Title (Hybrid (uploaded + outbound))" with nested
  parens).
- Kept the sr-only on the **dashboard list** (M82) —
  there's no config panel there, so it's the only
  accessible scope cue.
- Kept it on the **run-detail header** (M83) — also no
  config panel there.

**Validation:** live browser-smoke (7/7) + this fix
verified locally; e2e re-run against the deploy after
it builds.

**Lesson:** sr-only text is part of the accessibility
tree AND the `getByText` search space. Adding it where
the same string already appears visibly creates a
strict-mode landmine. Prefer scoping a11y labels to
places the info isn't otherwise present.

**Key files:** `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`

## V2-M107 — Shared draft-references mapper + select fragment

**Goal:** The `includedPapers → DraftReference[]`
mapping (+ its Prisma `select` shape) was copy-pasted
across three surfaces: the draft.md download route
(M99), the run-detail page (M102), and the showcase
page (M104). Identical logic in three places — exactly
the drift risk M96 flagged (two title extractions had
silently diverged before).

**What shipped:**

- New `lib/draft-references.ts`:
    - `INCLUDED_PAPER_REFERENCE_SELECT` — the Prisma
      select fragment, spread into all three run
      queries.
    - `toDraftReferences(includedPapers)` — the mapper,
      returning `DraftReference[]` via the shared
      `extractPaperTitle`.
    - `IncludedPaperForReference` — the joined input
      type.
- All three surfaces swapped to the shared select +
  mapper. The run page + showcase dropped their inline
  maps + the now-unused `extractPaperTitle` import.
- `formatReferenceLine` (paper-title.ts) param renamed
  `corpusItemId` → `paperId` so it accepts a
  `DraftReference` directly — the .md route now does
  `toDraftReferences(...).map(formatReferenceLine)`,
  one clean pipeline. Its 4 tests updated.
- 4 new `toDraftReferences` tests (V2 full metadata,
  uploaded-PDF nulls, no-heading null title, empty
  list).

**Net:** ~60 lines of duplicated mapping/select
collapsed to one helper; a future field addition
touches one file instead of three.

**Key files:** `lib/draft-references.ts`, `lib/paper-title.ts`, `app/api/runs/[id]/draft.md/route.ts`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`, `app/showcase/page.tsx`, `tests/lib/draft-references.test.ts`, `tests/lib/paper-title.test.ts`

## V2-M106 — Test the empty-references edge case on draft.md

**Goal:** The draft.md route (M99) only appends a
`## References` section `if (run.includedPapers.length
> 0)`. That branch had no test — a future refactor
could accidentally always-append the header (rendering
an empty "## References" with no entries) and no test
would catch it.

**What shipped:**

- New test: a completed run with `includedPapers: []`
  returns 200, the draft body intact, and NO
  "## References" header. Asserts `text.endsWith(draft)`
  to confirm nothing is appended after the body.

**Why this is worth a test:** the happy-path test
covers the references-present case; this pins the
references-absent case so both branches of the
`length > 0` guard are covered. A draft with zero
included papers is a real (if rare) state — an
uploaded_only run where the papers gate approved
nothing but the drafter still produced prose.

## V2-M105 — README reflects the full citation-export story

**Goal:** The README's walkthrough step 8 still
described only "a Download .md link" + the
faithfulness widget — written before the M95-M104
citation-export arc. It undersold what the app now
does: three rich downloads + a References section +
named citations.

**What shipped:**

- Step 8 rewritten to describe:
    - the on-page References section (M102) resolving
      inline `[paper_id]` markers.
    - all three downloads — `.md` (provenance header
      + references), `.bib` (author/year/journal/doi,
      keyed to match the draft so it drops into LaTeX),
      `.json` (structured audit).
    - the faithfulness widget now shows cited paper
      titles (M101).

**Also verified (no code change needed):** audited the
live e2e specs against this session's UI changes.
Playwright's `getByRole` converts the name op from `=`
to `*=` (substring) for internal role selectors when
`exact` is unset (confirmed in
`injectedScriptSource.js` `queryRole`), so the M74/M82
heading scope-badges + sr-only labels do NOT break
`getByRole("heading", { name: title })`. `getByText`
is substring by default, so the M86 "Rejected: "
prefix doesn't break `getByText(reason)`. The e2e
suite remains consistent with the UI.

**Key files:** `README.md`

## V2-M104 — Showcase page gets references + named citations

**Goal:** The public `/showcase` exemplar — the page
signed-out visitors land on to see "what Thoth
produces" — rendered the draft + faithfulness widget
but with opaque `[corpusItemId]` cuids (no titles, no
references). The authenticated run-detail view had been
fully polished (M100-M102); the marketing surface
lagged behind.

**What shipped:**

- Showcase query joins `includedPapers` (same shape as
  the run-detail page) + resolves cited-paper titles
  via the shared `loadCitedPaperTitles` (M100).
- `CitationFaithfulnessWidget` gets
  `claimChecksWithTitles` → named citations ("Graph
  Attention Networks [cm123]" not bare cuid).
- `DraftView` gets a `references` prop → the public
  exemplar now ends with a real References section.
- Reuses the exact helpers the authenticated view uses,
  so the public + private surfaces render identically.

**Why it matters:** the showcase is the conversion
surface — a signed-out researcher deciding whether Thoth
is credible. A review that ends with a proper References
list + named in-text citations reads as a real
publication; opaque cuids read as a prototype.

**Key files:** `app/showcase/page.tsx`

## V2-M103 — Remove stale eslint-disable in lib/now.ts

**Goal:** `pnpm lint` emitted a warning: "Unused
eslint-disable directive (no problems were reported from
'react-hooks/purity')" on `lib/now.ts:21`. M80's
assumption was wrong — the `react-hooks/purity` rule only
fires inside component/hook *render bodies*, not on a
plain module-level function. So `nowSnapshot`'s
`Date.now()` was never flagged; the disable directive was
dead from the moment it was written.

**What shipped:**

- Removed the unused `eslint-disable-next-line
  react-hooks/purity` directive.
- Rewrote the JSDoc to state the actual mechanism: the
  helper sidesteps the rule by moving `Date.now()` out
  of render bodies into plain module code (where the
  rule doesn't apply), rather than "centralising a
  disable" (there was nothing to disable).

**Why it matters:** a stale eslint-disable is a small
correctness smell — it implies a suppression that isn't
happening, which misleads the next reader + leaves a CI
warning. The extraction (M80) was still the right call;
only the justification comment was wrong.

**Key files:** `lib/now.ts`

## V2-M102 — On-page draft References section

**Goal:** The draft rendered on the run-detail page
(DraftView) shows the LLM's prose with inline
`[corpusItemId]` markers — opaque cuids with no key on
screen. M99 added a References appendix to the .md
*download*; this mirrors it for the *on-page* view so
the rendered draft is self-contained too.

**What shipped:**

- `DraftView` gains an optional `references:
  DraftReference[]` prop. When present, a References
  `<section>` renders below the draft body: each entry
  is `[corpusItemId]` (mono tag) + title + "— authors
  (year)" + "· venue" + DOI/arXiv link. Reuses
  `formatAuthors` (caps at 3 + et al.) for the author
  string.
- Run-detail page joins `includedPapers` (same shape
  as the .md route, M99) + maps them into the
  `references` prop via the shared `extractPaperTitle`.
- Showcase page omits `references` (read-only public
  exemplar, no per-claim resolution) — DraftView
  renders without the section, unchanged.
- DOI/arXiv link shows the URL with the `https://`
  stripped for compactness, opens in a new tab.

**Why structured props, not markdown:** rendering the
references as React (vs feeding a markdown string to a
second ReactMarkdown) avoids markdown re-parsing the
`[corpusItemId]` brackets as link references + keeps
the link `target=_blank rel=noopener` consistent with
the rest of the component.

**citedPaperTitle / reference coverage is now total:**
.bib (M97/M98), .md download (M99), audit.json (M100),
MCP audit (M100), on-page faithfulness widget (M101),
on-page draft references (M102). No surface shows a bare
cuid without a resolvable title anymore.

**Key files:** `components/runs/draft-view.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`

## V2-M101 — Citation faithfulness widget shows paper titles

**Goal:** The on-page CitationFaithfulnessWidget's
per-verdict rows rendered `[{paperId}] — supported` —
the same opaque-cuid problem M100 fixed for the
downloadable audit.json + MCP tool, but on the primary
*viewing* surface. A user reviewing their run's
citation audit saw `[cm7d9f2a1b] — unsupported` with no
idea which paper failed.

**What shipped:**

- `ClaimCheckRow` type gains optional `paperTitle`.
- The widget renders the resolved title in
  blue-ink-medium with the raw id demoted to a small
  mono tag beside it (`Graph Attention Networks
  [cm123]`). Falls back to the bare `[id]` mono tag
  when no title — so the draft's `[id]` markers are
  always cross-referenceable.
- The run-detail server page resolves titles via the
  shared `loadCitedPaperTitles` (M100) + enriches the
  claimChecks before passing them to the widget. Same
  helper, same query, as the audit.json route — no
  divergence risk.

**Surface coverage of citedPaperTitle:**
| Surface | shows title |
|---|---|
| audit.json download (M100) | ✓ |
| MCP get_citation_audit (M100) | ✓ |
| on-page faithfulness widget (M101) | ✓ |

**Key files:** `components/runs/CitationFaithfulnessWidget.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`

## V2-M100 — citedPaperTitle on audit claims (HTTP + MCP)

**Goal:** The citation audit's per-claim shape had
`citedPaperId` (an opaque corpusItemId) but no title.
A researcher reading the downloaded audit.json — or an
AI assistant calling get_citation_audit — saw
`citedPaperId: "cm123abc"` with no way to know which
paper a verdict was about.

**What shipped:**

- New `lib/cited-paper-titles.ts`:
  `loadCitedPaperTitles(paperIds)` de-dups the ids,
  one `corpusItem.findMany` lookup, returns a
  `Map<id, title | null>` (title via the shared
  `extractPaperTitle`; null for no-heading / deleted
  items).
- HTTP `audit.json` route: each claim gains
  `citedPaperTitle`.
- MCP `get_citation_audit`: same field added to the
  output Zod schema + handler (surface symmetry with
  the M77 metadata enrichment).
- 5 helper tests (empty-list-no-query, mapping,
  de-dup, missing-row, no-heading) + both consumer
  test suites updated with a `corpusItem.findMany`
  mock + `citedPaperTitle` assertions (including the
  null case for a deleted paper).

**Why a shared helper:** both surfaces need the exact
same id→title resolution; a helper keeps them from
diverging (the lesson from M96, where two title
extractions had silently drifted).

**This completes the citation-export arc** (M95 escape
· M96 shared title · M97 author/year/venue · M98 keys
resolve · M99 .md references · M100 audit titles). Every
citation surface — .bib, .md, audit.json, MCP — now
carries human-readable, self-consistent paper identity.

**Key files:** `lib/cited-paper-titles.ts`, `app/api/runs/[id]/audit.json/route.ts`, `lib/mcp/tools/get-citation-audit.ts`, `tests/lib/cited-paper-titles.test.ts`, `tests/api/runs-audit-json.test.ts`, `tests/lib/mcp/tools/get-citation-audit.test.ts`

## V2-M99 — References appendix on the draft .md download

**Goal:** With M98 the draft cites papers as
`[<corpusItemId>]` (cuids) — correct for resolving
against the .bib, but opaque to a human reading the
downloaded .md. There was no key explaining what
`[cm123abc]` referred to.

**What shipped:**

- The `draft.md` route appends a `## References`
  section listing every included paper, one line each:
  `- **[<corpusItemId>]** Title — Authors (Year) ·
  Venue · https://doi.org/<doi>`. The
  `[<corpusItemId>]` matches the inline markers so a
  reader can resolve them.
- New `formatReferenceLine` + `formatAuthors` helpers
  in `lib/paper-title.ts`:
    - `formatAuthors` caps at 3 names then "et al."
      (a 50-author physics paper shouldn't dump all
      50 into the reference line).
    - `formatReferenceLine` omits each section
      (authors / year / venue / link) when absent, so
      an uploaded PDF with only a title renders
      cleanly as `- **[id]** Title`.
    - arXiv link used when there's no DOI.
- Author/year/venue come from the same `discoveredAs`
  join the .bib route uses (M97) — V2 papers get rich
  references, uploaded PDFs get title-only.
- Appendix only added when there are included papers.
- 11 new tests (formatAuthors matrix, formatReferenceLine
  full/null-title/arxiv/uploaded) + the draft.md route
  test asserts the appended References block.

**Why in the download, not the stored draft:** the
stored draft is the LLM's raw output (the cite-check
node parses its `[id]` markers — mustn't perturb it).
The References appendix is a presentation concern
layered on at download time, like the M76 provenance
header.

**Key files:** `lib/paper-title.ts`, `app/api/runs/[id]/draft.md/route.ts`, `tests/lib/paper-title.test.ts`, `tests/api/runs-draft-md.test.ts`

## V2-M98 — BibTeX citation keys match the draft's `[paper_id]` markers (real bug)

**Goal / the bug:** The whole value proposition of the
`.bib` download is "paste the draft into LaTeX, drop in
the .bib, every citation resolves." But it didn't —
because the keys didn't match.

- The drafter writes citations as `[<corpusItemId>]`
  (see `lib/prompts/draft-review.ts` line 17 "paper_id
  is the corpus item id" + `assessor.ts`:
  `claim.includedPaperId = inc.corpusItemId`). So the
  draft markdown contains `[cm123abc]`-style markers.
- The `.bib` route (M37) generated keys as
  `paper_${idx+1}` → `@article{paper_001,...}`.
- These never matched. A researcher pasting the draft +
  .bib into LaTeX would get **every citation
  undefined** — the .bib was decorative, not functional.

The M37 comment even *claimed* "citation key matches the
paper_NNN pattern the assessor uses" — but the assessor
never used paper_NNN. The comment was wrong from day one.

**What shipped:**

- `.bib` route now sets `citationKey = ip.corpusItemId`
  — the exact id the drafter cites. Added `corpusItemId`
  to the IncludedPaper select.
- Removed the now-unused `idx` map parameter.
- `sanitiseKey` (M37) already handles cuid-shaped keys
  (alphanumeric pass straight through), so no escaping
  change needed.
- Route test fixtures gain `corpusItemId`; assertions
  check `@article{cm_corpus_a,` + `@misc{cm_corpus_b,`
  instead of the bogus paper_NNN.

**How this was found:** tracing the M95→M96→M97 BibTeX
trail back to "does the key actually match the draft?"
— it didn't. The most consequential fix in the BibTeX
chain: the prior three made the entries *clean*, this
one makes them *resolve*.

**Key files:** `app/api/runs/[id]/citations.bib/route.ts`, `tests/api/runs-citations-bib.test.ts`

## V2-M97 — BibTeX entries gain author / year / venue

**Goal:** The exported `.bib` only had title + DOI +
arXiv id. A BibTeX entry without `author` + `year` is
barely usable in a real manuscript — the whole point
of the download is to paste citations into LaTeX.
V2 discovered papers carry authors + publicationYear +
venue on the `DiscoveredPaper` row; we just weren't
threading them through.

**What shipped:**

- `BibTexPaper` type gains optional `authors`, `year`,
  `venue`.
- `paperToBibtex` emits:
    - `author = {A and B and C}` (BibTeX's " and "
      join) when authors is non-empty.
    - `year = {2022}` when year is set.
    - `journal = {NeurIPS}` when venue is set (the
      @article-canonical field; @misc tolerates it).
  Each is omitted when absent, so uploaded PDFs (which
  only have an OCR'd title) don't emit empty fields.
- `citations.bib` route joins `corpusItem.discoveredAs`
  (the DiscoveredPaper back-relation) + maps
  authors/publicationYear/venue into the BibTexPaper.
  Null for uploaded PDFs.
- Author names emitted verbatim (escaped) — no
  "First Last" → "Last, First" reformatting, which
  would mangle non-Western name order.
- 3 new bibtex-lib tests (present / absent / empty-list
  author) + the route test now includes a V2 paper
  asserting the joined author/year/journal.

**Why journal-not-booktitle for venue:** most venues in
the discovery providers are journals or arXiv; @article
+ journal is the safe default. A future refinement could
pick booktitle for conference proceedings, but the
provider data doesn't reliably distinguish.

**Key files:** `lib/bibtex.ts`, `app/api/runs/[id]/citations.bib/route.ts`, `tests/lib/bibtex.test.ts`, `tests/api/runs-citations-bib.test.ts`

## V2-M96 — Shared paper-title extraction (corpus list + .bib parity)

**Goal:** Two surfaces extract a paper title from OCR'd
markdown, and they'd diverged:
  - `corpusItemLabel` (M47/M68) found the first H1/H2
    heading + ran `sanitiseTitle` (strips markdown
    emphasis, LaTeX, quotes).
  - The `citations.bib` route did its OWN inline
    extraction: `parsedMarkdown.split("\n").find(l =>
    l.startsWith("# "))` — H1-only, NO sanitisation. A
    paper titled `# **Attention Is All You Need**`
    leaked `title = {\*\*Attention...\*\*}` into the
    BibTeX (asterisks escaped as literal text by M95
    but still wrong).

**What shipped:**

- New `lib/paper-title.ts` with two exports:
    - `sanitiseTitle(raw)` — moved verbatim from
      corpus-item-list.tsx.
    - `extractPaperTitle(markdown)` — first H1/H2
      heading, sanitised, or null. Matches H1 AND H2
      (the .bib's old inline version missed H2-only
      OCR output, e.g. papers whose title OCR'd as
      `## Title`).
- `corpusItemLabel` now calls `extractPaperTitle`, then
  applies its display-specific 140-char truncation +
  source fallback.
- `citations.bib` route swapped to `extractPaperTitle`.
  The .bib now gets the SAME clean title the UI shows.
- corpus-item-label.test.ts updated to import
  `sanitiseTitle` from the new path.
- 8 new tests for `extractPaperTitle` (H1, H2,
  blank-skip, LaTeX/emphasis, null/empty/undefined,
  no-heading, empty-after-sanitise) + a reachability
  smoke test for the moved `sanitiseTitle`.

**Why this matters:** a researcher's exported .bib is
the artefact they paste into a manuscript. A title
with stray markdown is embarrassing + may need manual
cleanup. Now it matches what they saw in the UI.

**Key files:** `lib/paper-title.ts`, `components/corpus/corpus-item-list.tsx`, `app/api/runs/[id]/citations.bib/route.ts`, `tests/lib/paper-title.test.ts`, `tests/components/corpus-item-label.test.ts`

## V2-M95 — Fix BibTeX escape: %, $, &, # were unescaped

**Goal:** Real correctness bug in `bibtexEscape`. The
function escaped `\`, `{`, `}`, `@` but missed `%`,
`$`, `&`, `#`. The most dangerous omission was `%`:
BibTeX treats `%` as a line-comment marker, so a
paper titled `"Cost 50% off"` would render as
`title = {Cost 50% off}` and the `%` would comment
out the closing `}` — corrupting the entry and
likely the whole .bib file downstream of it.

**What shipped:**

- `bibtexEscape` regex extended from `[\\{}@]` to
  `[\\{}@%$&#]`. Each gets `\`-prefixed.
- JSDoc updated to explain WHY each character needs
  escaping (line comment, math mode, LaTeX column,
  LaTeX parameter), and why `_`, `^`, `~` are
  *deliberately not* escaped (the `{}` wrapper
  + downstream LaTeX renderers handle them).
- 1 new unit test asserts escaping for a title
  combining all four newly-handled chars.

**Why this slipped:** the original M37 implementation
only thought about ASCII syntax characters (`{}`,
`@`). The semantic specials (`%` for comments, `$`
for math) come from BibTeX/LaTeX conventions, not
syntax — easy to miss until a paper title with `%`
shows up.

**Key files:** `lib/bibtex.ts`, `tests/lib/bibtex.test.ts`

## V2-M94 — Hoist `new Date(lastRun.createdAt)` on the evals page

**Goal:** Same pattern as M93, applied to the public
`/evals` page. The `lastRun.createdAt` was being
re-constructed twice — once for the formatted display
string, once for the `<time dateTime=...>` ISO
attribute.

**What shipped:**

- `const lastRunAt = lastRun ? new Date(lastRun.createdAt) : null`
  hoisted before the format branch.
- The `lastRunDate` derivation reads from `lastRunAt`
  instead of constructing a new Date.
- The `<time>` element's `dateTime` reads
  `lastRunAt.toISOString()` instead of
  `new Date(lastRun.createdAt).toISOString()`.
- Added `lastRunAt` to the conditional render guard so
  TS narrows correctly to non-null inside the block.

**Key files:** `app/evals/page.tsx`

## V2-M93 — Hoist `new Date(p.updatedAt)` out of project-list JSX

**Goal:** The project-list row JSX called
`new Date(p.updatedAt)` four times — once for the
`dateTime` attribute, once for the `title` tooltip,
once for the relative-time computation, once for the
fallback absolute-date copy. Tiny perf footnote
(Date constructor is cheap); mostly a readability +
maintainability problem.

**What shipped:**

- Switched the `.map((p) => (...JSX...))` to
  `.map((p) => { const updatedAt = new Date(p.updatedAt);
  return (...JSX referring to updatedAt...); })`.
- All four JSX references read `updatedAt.X()` instead
  of `new Date(p.updatedAt).X()`. The expression of
  intent is clearer — there's exactly one timestamp per
  row.
- Closing `; })` replaces `))` to match the new IIFE
  arrow-function-with-body shape.

**Why not also `runs[0].createdAt`:** that's only
read once on the row (for the latest-run pill's status
text), so hoisting wouldn't simplify anything.

**Key files:** `components/projects/project-list.tsx`

## V2-M92 — Sweep locale-default toLocaleString calls

**Goal:** M91 fixed `compactCount`. Four more
`toLocaleString()` calls (no locale arg) lurked across
the codebase, each producing different output by
runner / visitor locale:
  - `TokenSpendBadge` tooltip (billable, budget, in,
    out, cache token counts × 5 calls)
  - `ProjectTokenStat` tooltip (in, out, cache × 3
    calls)
  - Run-detail page `runLabel` prop (date)
  - Project page runs-list `absolute` (date)

**What shipped:**

- Number formatters → `.toLocaleString("en-US")` to
  match M91's `compactCount` convention.
- Date formatters → `.toLocaleString("en-GB")` to
  match the existing project-list eyebrow + evals
  page convention (already explicit on those
  surfaces).
- Codebase is now zero locale-default `toLocaleString`
  calls. `grep -rn "toLocaleString\(\)\)"` returns
  nothing in production code.

**Why two different hardcoded locales:** numbers + dates
benefit from different conventions. "en-US" produces
"1,234" + "5/28/2026, 12:42:33 PM"; "en-GB" produces
"1,234" + "28/05/2026, 12:42:33". The number format
is the same; the date format differs — and en-GB's
DD/MM/YYYY is more readable for the engineering
surfaces it appears on (where exact timestamp matters
more than localised familiarity).

**Key files:** `components/runs/token-spend-badge.tsx`, `components/projects/project-token-stat.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`

## V2-M91 — compactCount hardcodes "en-US" locale

**Goal:** `compactCount(1_234)` was returning
`n.toLocaleString()` — locale-dependent. On the CI
runner's default `en_US.UTF-8` it rendered `"1,234"`
(passing the tests); but on a C/POSIX locale runner
or a server with `LC_ALL=de_DE` the same code would
return `"1234"` or `"1.234"` and the tests would
break.

**What shipped:**

- `compactCount` calls `.toLocaleString("en-US")`
  with an explicit locale. Output is now stable
  regardless of runner locale.
- JSDoc explains the dual rationale (user-visible
  consistency + test stability).

**Why en-US and not the user's locale:** the token
counts are an engineering surface, not a marketing
one — uniform formatting is more valuable than
matching the visitor's expected comma vs dot. A
future i18n pass could thread `acceptLanguage` from
headers, but the call sites today (token spend
badges) don't have that context.

**Key files:** `lib/format.ts`

## V2-M90 — Extract `useRefreshPolling` shared hook

**Goal:** Three near-identical inline `useEffect`
blocks polled `router.refresh()` with visibility-aware
pause/resume:
  - `RefreshTickList` (run-status live updates)
  - `CorpusItemList` (PENDING/PARSING items)
  - Plus the M82-era pill effect was implicitly the
    same shape

Each had its own 30-line block with `setInterval` +
`visibilitychange` listener + early-return-on-disabled.
Real duplication: any future tweak (interval bump,
backoff, cancellation policy) had to touch every site.

**What shipped:**

- New `useRefreshPolling(enabled, intervalMs = 2000)`
  hook in `components/runs/use-refresh-polling.ts`.
  Encapsulates: interval start/stop, visibility-pause +
  tab-return-refresh, router import.
- `RefreshTick` / `RefreshTickList` slimmed to compute
  the "is anything active" signature, pass through to
  the hook. Component file shrinks from 67 to 30 lines.
- `CorpusItemList` polling effect (M61) similarly
  swapped to the hook. Removes ~30 lines of inline
  effect body + the visibility-listener boilerplate.
- The visibility-pause logic — which was the load-
  bearing part for free-tier Vercel invocation budget —
  now lives in exactly one place with one set of
  JSDoc'd rationale.

**Why a hook, not a higher-order component:** the call
sites need to keep their own data (the runs[] / items[]
prop) so they can compute the "enabled" derivation
themselves. A hook lets the caller stay in control of
its data shape; a HOC would force a fixed prop name.

**Key files:** `components/runs/use-refresh-polling.ts`, `components/runs/refresh-tick.tsx`, `components/corpus/corpus-item-list.tsx`

## V2-M89 — EditProjectDialog auto-populates providers on first switch to outbound

**Goal:** V1 projects (originally created as
uploaded_only) have `searchProviders: []` stored. A
user editing such a project and flipping the scope
radio to "Outbound search" saw empty provider
checkboxes + a disabled Save button until they
clicked one. The new-project dialog uses
`{openalex, arxiv}` as the first-time default; the
edit dialog now matches.

**What shipped:**

- `changeScope(next)` wrapper around `setScope`. On
  transitions to outbound/hybrid where providers is
  empty, auto-populates `{openalex, arxiv}` — the
  same default the new-project dialog applies. Only
  fires when providers is empty so a user flipping
  between outbound ↔ hybrid keeps their picks.
- All three scope radios (uploaded_only, outbound,
  hybrid) go through `changeScope`.

**Why not also clear providers when switching to
uploaded_only:** the server's M38 PATCH endpoint
ignores `searchProviders` when scope is
uploaded_only, so the user's selections are kept in
state but effectively shelved — a quick toggle back
to outbound finds the same providers checked. Clearing
would be punishing the user for exploring.

**Key files:** `components/projects/edit-project-dialog.tsx`

## V2-M88 — RunsBreakdown splits REJECTED into its own bucket

**Goal:** Completes the M86 → M87 → M88 chain. M49's
`bucketRuns` lumped REJECTED + FAILED into one "failed"
bucket. After M86/M87 visually differentiated them, the
project-page summary "1 completed · 2 failed" was
ambiguous when the truth was "1 completed · 1 rejected ·
1 failed".

**What shipped:**

- `bucketRuns` return shape extended with a `rejected`
  field. FAILED + REJECTED are now distinct buckets.
- Summary copy renders "X rejected" + "Y failed"
  separately, hidden when zero.
- 5 unit tests updated (mixed list, empty list, V2
  active, REJECTED-as-its-own-bucket + unknown status
  forward-compat).
- Existing FAILED-only / REJECTED-only edge case is now
  two parallel assertions for symmetry.

**Surface coverage of the M86-M88 chain:**
| Surface | REJECTED treatment |
|---|---|
| Run-detail panel (M86) | Neutral papyrus + "Rejected: " prefix |
| Run status pill (M87) | `outline` variant (was `destructive`) |
| Project page breakdown (M88) | Own bucket, separate from FAILED |

**Key files:** `components/runs/runs-breakdown.tsx`, `tests/components/runs-breakdown.test.ts`

## V2-M87 — Status pill: REJECTED variant matches M86's "informational, not error"

**Goal:** M86 styled the REJECTED *panel* in neutral
papyrus to distinguish user-initiated aborts from
true agent failures. The `RunStatusPill`'s variant
map still had both REJECTED + FAILED mapped to
`destructive` (red). A runs list with a mix of
completed / rejected / failed runs read as half-red
when really only the FAILED ones were errors.

**What shipped:**

- `REJECTED` → `outline` (neutral) in the
  RunStatusPill variant map.
- `FAILED` → `destructive` (unchanged).
- M48's M86 mention added to the in-file comment so a
  future reader understands the asymmetry isn't an
  oversight.

**Why outline and not secondary:** outline reads as
neutral state ("nothing special happening"); secondary
reads as "this is in-progress" (used for PLANNING /
DRAFTING / etc.). REJECTED is terminal, not in-progress
— outline is the right shape.

**Key files:** `components/runs/run-status-pill.tsx`

## V2-M86 — Distinguish REJECTED from FAILED in the run-detail panel

**Goal:** Both REJECTED + FAILED runs have a non-null
`failureReason` and triggered the same destructive-
red panel (M51). But the panels mean different
things: FAILED = agent crashed (rate limit, bug,
provider outage); REJECTED = user deliberately
aborted at an HITL gate. Treating them visually
identically made REJECTED runs look like errors the
user should investigate, when really they were
user-driven decisions.

**What shipped:**

- Panel styling forks on `run.status`:
    - REJECTED → neutral papyrus/blue-ink (informational).
      Prefixed "Rejected: " before the reason so the
      copy is unambiguous.
    - FAILED → existing destructive red (unchanged).
- "Failed during: [step]" caption hidden for REJECTED
  runs — that copy implies a step crashed, but
  REJECTED ends at an HITL gate by user choice
  before any step crashed.
- "Start new run" recovery button unchanged — both
  terminal-non-success states benefit from the
  shortcut.

**Why visual differentiation matters:** users who
reject a plan because their question needs
refinement shouldn't come back to a red error panel.
The rejection is the user *informing* the agent, not
the agent failing.

**Key files:** `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`

## V2-M85 — relativeTime: fix the 360-364 day "this year" hole

**Goal:** M55's `relativeTime()` had a tier-ordering
bug. For inputs between 360 and 364 days:
  - `months = Math.floor(days / 30)` = 12, so the
    `months < 12` check failed.
  - `years = Math.floor(days / 365)` = 0, so the
    fallback returned `format(-0, "year")` which Intl
    renders as `"this year"` (with `numeric: "auto"`).
A timestamp from a year ago rendering as "this year" is
the opposite of useful.

**What shipped:**

- Year-boundary check moved BEFORE the month tier. If
  `days >= 365`, compute years from days. Otherwise
  (30..364 days), compute months from days — which can
  legitimately produce "12 months ago" for the 360-364
  day window.
- Three new test cases (360 days, 364 days, 365 days)
  pin the boundary. The 365 days case asserts "last
  year" — `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` with
  `numeric: "auto"` renders -1 year as "last year",
  not "1 year ago".

**Key files:** `lib/relative-time.ts`, `tests/lib/relative-time.test.ts`

## V2-M84 — compactCount escalates "1000k" → "1.0M"

**Goal:** M60 introduced `compactCount(n)`. The 10k..1M
tier used `(abs / 1000).toFixed(0)` — at 999,500 this
produced `"1000k"`, an ugly outlier next to the
neighboring "1.0M" rendering. M60's test even
documented the surface as expected behaviour; this
fixes that.

**What shipped:**

- `compactCount` adds a `abs >= 999_500` check inside
  the 10k..1M branch that escalates to the M tier when
  the would-be k-value rounds to 1000. The closed-form
  threshold (999_500) matches what
  `Math.round(abs/1000)` would produce without an
  intermediate divide-then-round-then-compare.
- Two existing tests updated: the "999_500 → 1000k"
  expectation became a new "escalates to M-tier" test
  covering both 999_500 and 999_999.

**Why a hard threshold instead of dynamic rounding:**
performance + clarity. The closed-form check is one
comparison; the JSDoc explains the boundary so a
future maintainer doesn't think "weird magic number".

**Key files:** `lib/format.ts`, `tests/lib/format.test.ts`

## V2-M83 — Same a11y badge pattern on the run-detail header

**Goal:** M82 cleaned the project headings'
accessible names. The run-detail page header has the
same "outbound"/"hybrid" scope badge as a sibling of
the h1 (not nested — good), but the badge itself was
a bare `<span>` without aria-hidden + sr-only
treatment. Screen reader users heard just "outbound"
— ambiguous out of context.

**What shipped:**

- Run-detail header scope badge → `aria-hidden="true"`
  (decorative).
- Sibling `<span className="sr-only">` provides
  natural-language equivalent: "Outbound search" /
  "Hybrid search".
- Consistent with the M82 pattern on project list
  + project detail surfaces.

**Key files:** `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`

## V2-M82 — Heading accessible name cleanup

**Goal:** M54 (latest-run pill) and M74 (scope badge)
both added `<span>` children inside the project heading
(`<h2>` on dashboard, `<h1>` on project detail). The
heading's accessible name became "Project Title v2
pending" — three issues:

1. Screen-reader heading nav reads the noisy
   concatenation, not the clean title.
2. Playwright's `getByRole("heading", { name: title,
   exact: true })` would fail to match.
3. Even substring matching is fragile if the badge
   ever moves.

**What shipped:**

- Scope badge (`v2` / `hybrid`) on both project list
  h2 + project detail h1 gets `aria-hidden="true"`.
  Decorative — visual cue only.
- Sibling `<span className="sr-only">{` (Outbound
  search)`}</span>` provides the same info to AT users
  without inflating the heading's accessible name
  visible to selectors. (Wait — it IS still inside
  the heading; sr-only just hides visually, not from
  a11y tree. But the parenthesised wording is now
  natural-language, not a UI label.)
- Latest-run pill on the dashboard project list moved
  OUT of the h2, rendered as a sibling `<p>` below
  the title. The h2's accessible name becomes the
  bare title text. Visual layout preserved — the pill
  still sits with the title in the editorial card.

**Why two different approaches:** the scope badge
*describes* the project (so an sr-only parenthetical
makes sense inline). The run status is *transient
state* about a specific run — not a property of the
heading itself, so it belongs outside the heading
tree.

**Key files:** `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`, `components/projects/project-list.tsx`

## V2-M81 — Fourth `Date.now()` caller + nowSnapshot tests

**Goal:** M80 swept three server pages. Missed a fourth:
`app/admin/guests/page.tsx` had its own eslint-disable
+ rationale comment for the same pattern. Also: the new
helper had no unit tests.

**What shipped:**

- Admin guests page swapped to `nowSnapshot()`; its
  eslint-disable + the 3-line rationale comment removed
  (justification now lives once, in `lib/now.ts`).
- 2 unit tests on `nowSnapshot`:
    - returns a finite positive ms timestamp.
    - returns a value within `[Date.now() before,
      Date.now() after]` — sanity check that it isn't
      accidentally re-implemented as a constant or
      build-time inline.

**Why test such a tiny helper:** future refactors might
be tempted to "simplify" by inlining or pre-computing
the value; the bracketing assertion catches both
mistakes before deploy.

**Key files:** `app/admin/guests/page.tsx`, `tests/lib/now.test.ts`

## V2-M80 — Extract `nowSnapshot()` helper

**Goal:** Three server pages (dashboard, project detail,
run detail) each carried their own `// eslint-disable-
next-line react-hooks/purity -- ...` comment justifying
a `Date.now()` call in render. Each comment said
basically the same thing — "server component, invoked
per request, wall-clock is fine". Code smell:
duplicated justifications + visual noise.

**What shipped:**

- New `lib/now.ts` exports `nowSnapshot(): number` — a
  thin wrapper around `Date.now()` with the eslint-
  disable + the rationale comment in one place.
- All three server pages swapped to `nowSnapshot()`,
  removing their per-site disable lines.
- JSDoc warns against using the helper in client
  components (where the rule's "don't call impure
  functions in render" advice is genuinely correct —
  client components should `useEffect` + `useState` to
  tick).

**Why a single named helper instead of disabling the
rule globally:** the rule is good for client components
where impure render-time calls cause subtle re-render
bugs. We want the rule active everywhere by default;
the helper is a focused, named exemption.

**Key files:** `lib/now.ts`, `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`

## V2-M79 — MCP `get_search_queries` + `list_discovered_papers` project context

**Goal:** Completes the MCP enrichment chain (M77 → M78
→ M79). The remaining two V2 MCP tools —
`get_search_queries` and `list_discovered_papers` —
returned `reviewId` + `searchScope` but no
`projectTitle` or `reviewQuestion`. An AI assistant
calling these still needed a second lookup to talk
about the discovery sweep meaningfully.

**What shipped:**

- `getSearchQueriesOutput` + `listDiscoveredPapersOutput`
  Zod schemas both gain `projectTitle: z.string()` +
  `reviewQuestion: z.string()`.
- Both handlers' Prisma selects join `project.title` +
  the run's `question` field.
- Existing unit-test fixtures extended; success-path
  assertions check the new fields' exact values.

**Why no `runStartedAt` / `runCompletedAt`:** these two
tools are about the discovery sweep, not the run's
overall lifecycle. The audit + draft tools (which DO
include those timestamps) are appropriate places —
duplicating here adds noise.

**Surface-symmetry chain (complete):**
| Tool | + projectTitle | + reviewQuestion | + run timestamps |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_citation_audit` (M77) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `get_review_draft` (M78) | ✓ | (already had `researchQuestion`) | (already had `generatedAt`) |
| `get_search_queries` (M79) | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| `list_discovered_papers` (M79) | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| `list_reviews` (already had) | ✓ (`projectName`) | ✓ (`researchQuestion`) | ✓ |

**Key files:** `lib/mcp/tools/get-search-queries.ts`, `lib/mcp/tools/list-discovered-papers.ts`, `tests/lib/mcp/tools/get-search-queries.test.ts`, `tests/lib/mcp/tools/list-discovered-papers.test.ts`

## V2-M78 — MCP `get_review_draft` + list_reviews V2 status doc

**Goal:** M77 enriched `get_citation_audit` with project
context. The sibling MCP tool `get_review_draft` had the
same gap: it returned `researchQuestion` but no
`projectTitle`, so an AI assistant fetching a draft had
to do a second lookup to know what project the draft
belonged to. Also discovered: `list_reviews` schema
documented the V1 status enum members in a docstring,
but V2 added four states (DISCOVERING /
AWAITING_DISCOVERY_APPROVAL / FETCHING / SCREENING) that
the docstring missed — though the runtime is fine
(`z.string()` is forward-compatible).

**What shipped:**

- `getReviewDraftOutput` Zod schema gains
  `projectTitle: z.string()`.
- `getReviewDraft` handler's Prisma select joins
  `project.title`.
- `list_reviews` status field's inline docstring
  enumerates both V1 + V2 states ("V1: ... V2 outbound:
  DISCOVERING|AWAITING_DISCOVERY_APPROVAL|FETCHING|
  SCREENING.").
- Existing `get-review-draft.test.ts` fixture +
  assertion extended with `projectTitle: "GAT Review"`.

**Why no schema bump on list_reviews:** the runtime
type was already `z.string()`. The fix is a docstring
update for human readers + AI consumers reading the
schema. No backwards-incompatible change.

**Key files:** `lib/mcp/tools/get-review-draft.ts`, `lib/mcp/tools/list-reviews.ts`, `tests/lib/mcp/tools/get-review-draft.test.ts`

## V2-M77 — MCP `get_citation_audit` mirrors the HTTP audit shape

**Goal:** M75 enriched the HTTP `/api/runs/[id]/audit.json`
response with `projectTitle`, `reviewQuestion`,
`runStartedAt`, `runCompletedAt`. The MCP
`get_citation_audit` tool — same data surface, AI
assistant entry point — still returned the bare M35
shape. AI clients (Claude.ai, Cursor) calling the tool
had to look up the project context separately to
discuss the audit meaningfully.

**What shipped:**

- `getCitationAuditOutput` Zod schema extended with the
  same four metadata fields the HTTP route ships:
  `projectTitle`, `reviewQuestion`, `runStartedAt`
  (ISO), `runCompletedAt` (ISO or null).
- `getCitationAudit` handler's Prisma select extended
  to `createdAt`, `completedAt`, `question`, and the
  joined `project.title`.
- `auditGeneratedAt` deliberately omitted — MCP
  responses are synchronous reads, so "now" is
  implicit to the caller. Only the HTTP saved-to-disk
  case needs that field.
- Existing unit tests updated: both fixtures now
  provide the new fields; assertions check exact
  metadata values + null-completion edge case.

**Key files:** `lib/mcp/tools/get-citation-audit.ts`, `tests/lib/mcp/tools/get-citation-audit.test.ts`

## V2-M76 — Provenance headers on .md + .bib downloads

**Goal:** M75 stamped the audit JSON with project +
question + timestamps so saved copies stay
identifiable. Same gap on the .md (draft) and .bib
(citations) downloads — once on disk, both are opaque
about which review they came from.

**What shipped:**

- **`draft.md`** route prepends an HTML-comment
  provenance header before the markdown body:
    ```
    <!--
      Thoth review draft
      Project: <title>
      Question: <question>
      Run started: <iso>
      Run completed: <iso or omitted>
      Generated: <iso>
    -->

    <draft body>
    ```
  HTML comments render to nothing in every common
  Markdown processor (Pandoc, GFM, react-markdown,
  mkdocs) so the prepended block is invisible when the
  draft is rendered but preserved as text in the file.
  Embedded `--` is sanitised to `- -` so a title with a
  double-dash can't accidentally close the comment.
- **`citations.bib`** route prepends `%`-prefixed
  metadata lines before the existing `buildBibtexFile`
  output. BibTeX treats `%` lines as comments, so the
  metadata is visible at the top but ignored by every
  parser. Newlines in titles / questions are sanitised
  to spaces so a stray `\n` can't break out of the
  comment.
- Existing test fixtures extended with `completedAt` +
  `question`; existing body assertions migrated to
  partial `.toContain` checks for the new header fields
  while preserving the bare-body assertions.

**Why HTML comments not YAML frontmatter on .md:** YAML
frontmatter is the heavier-but-more-machine-readable
choice (Pandoc / Hugo / Jekyll / R Markdown all
recognise it). But react-markdown — what the Thoth
showcase + run-detail surfaces render with — does NOT
strip frontmatter by default; users viewing the .md
file in a tool that doesn't recognise YAML would see
the raw `---` block as document content. HTML comments
are universally rendered as nothing.

**Key files:** `app/api/runs/[id]/draft.md/route.ts`, `app/api/runs/[id]/citations.bib/route.ts`, `tests/api/runs-draft-md.test.ts`, `tests/api/runs-citations-bib.test.ts`

## V2-M75 — Audit JSON stamped with project + run metadata

**Goal:** The downloadable audit JSON (M35, refined in
M66) carried just the cite_check verdicts + counts. A
researcher who saved the audit and revisited it weeks
later had to look up the run id to know which review the
audit was for. Stamp the payload with enough metadata to
make the file self-describing.

**What shipped:**

- `audit.json` payload gains:
    - `projectTitle` — humanised project title.
    - `reviewQuestion` — the research question this
      audit measured against.
    - `runStartedAt` (ISO) — when the agent kicked off.
    - `runCompletedAt` (ISO or null) — when the draft
      landed.
    - `auditGeneratedAt` (ISO) — when the JSON file was
      produced. Lets a downstream tool tell two saved
      copies apart if cite_check was re-run.
- The run query selects `completedAt` + `question` in
  addition to the existing fields.
- Existing test fixtures extended with `completedAt` +
  `question` + `project.title`; new assertions on the
  metadata fields, plus a parseable-ISO check on
  `auditGeneratedAt` (the value is clock-dependent so we
  can't assert an exact string).

**Why no MCP shape change:** the `get_citation_audit`
MCP tool's response shape predates this — adding fields
is backwards-compatible, so the MCP tool could mirror
this enrichment in a follow-up if needed.

**Key files:** `app/api/runs/[id]/audit.json/route.ts`, `tests/api/runs-audit-json.test.ts`

## V2-M74 — Scope badge on project detail header

**Goal:** The dashboard project list (M54-era) shows a
small "v2"/"hybrid" badge next to the title for outbound/
hybrid projects. The project detail page didn't — once
the user was inside, the scope info was buried inside the
discovery config panel further down. Bring the visual
consistency to the detail page header.

**What shipped:**

- Project header h1 now renders the same "v2" / "hybrid"
  badge next to the title for outbound/hybrid projects,
  matching the dashboard list styling.
- Tooltip uses the existing `SCOPE_LABEL` map so the
  copy ("Outbound search" / "Hybrid (uploaded +
  outbound)") matches the discovery config panel below.
- Uploaded_only projects render the title bare — no
  badge needed since uploaded_only is the V1 default.

**Key files:** `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`

## V2-M73 — README v2.0.0 entry reflects current shipping log

**Goal:** The README v2.0.0 line claimed "the 10 audit
bugs found-and-fixed in the post-M4 review pass". True at
v2.0.0 cut but stale: the V2 roadmap has continued well
past that — 30+ post-audit milestones covering UX polish,
CRUD gaps, status visibility, observability, OCR title
sanitisation, human-readable downloads, and HITL gate
ergonomics.

**What shipped:**

- README's v2.0.0 changelog entry updated: replaces the
  "10 audit bugs" wording with a short list of the
  follow-on theme groups (UX polish, CRUD gaps, status
  visibility, observability, OCR sanitisation,
  human-readable downloads, HITL ergonomics). Points at
  the roadmap doc for the full per-milestone log.

**Why no number:** the milestone count is a moving target
while the loop is still firing. The themes describe what
shipped without forcing the README into lockstep with the
roadmap header count.

**Key files:** `README.md`

## V2-M72 — HITL reject panels clear reason on Cancel

**Goal:** Same class of state-leak as M70/M71, applied to
the Reject inputs on `PlanApprovalCard` and
`DiscoveryApprovalCard`. A user who:
  1. Clicked "Reject"
  2. Typed a reason ("plan is too narrow")
  3. Changed their mind and clicked "Cancel"
  4. Later re-opened the reject panel
…saw their abandoned reason in the textarea. Not actively
harmful (they can clear + re-type) but inconsistent with
M70/M71 and risks the user accidentally submitting an
outdated reason.

**What shipped:**

- `PlanApprovalCard` Cancel button now does
  `setShowReject(false); setRejectReason("");` instead of
  just hiding the panel.
- `DiscoveryApprovalCard` same fix.
- `PapersApprovalCard` left alone — its reject sends a
  hardcoded `"User aborted at papers gate"` reason
  (server-side default for the no-input gate), so there's
  no state to leak.

**Why not also clear on a 4xx error from the
approve/reject API:** if the network fails or the
checkpoint was decided concurrently, the user wants to
retry with the same reason. Only the Cancel path
explicitly throws the reason away.

**Key files:** `components/runs/plan-approval-card.tsx`, `components/runs/discovery-approval-card.tsx`

## V2-M71 — EditProjectDialog resets to props on close

**Goal:** Same class of bug as M70, applied to the edit
flow. `EditProjectDialog` initialises its state from the
`project` prop on first mount via `useState(project.title)`
etc. — but React only honours the initial value on first
mount; subsequent re-opens see the *previous edit's* state.
A user who opened Edit, typed a new title, then cancelled,
saw their abandoned edits when re-opening (worse than M70:
the data shown was *misleading* about what the project
actually contained).

**What shipped:**

- `resetToProject()` helper restoring every field to
  match the current `project` prop. Mirrors the
  initial `useState(...)` expressions.
- `handleOpenChange(next)` wrapper: forwards the flip
  and calls `resetToProject()` on close.
- Same "reset only on close, not on open" posture as
  M70 — keeps re-attempt UX intact after a 400.
- Successful save path unchanged: `router.refresh()` re-
  renders the page with the new project values, which
  pass through `project` prop to a still-closed dialog,
  so the next open shows canonical values either way.

**Key files:** `components/projects/edit-project-dialog.tsx`

## V2-M70 — NewProjectDialog resets on close

**Goal:** The dialog kept React state across opens — so a
user who created project #1 (title "GAT review", scope
outbound) and then opened the dialog again to create
project #2 saw "GAT review" pre-filled in the title
field. Different projects mean different titles +
questions; the leak made the dialog feel buggy and
risked the user accidentally re-creating an old project.

**What shipped:**

- New `resetForm()` helper restoring every field to
  its initial state (title "", question "", scope
  `uploaded_only`, providers `{openalex, arxiv}`, year
  range empty, max hits empty, skipDiscoveryGate false,
  error null).
- New `handleOpenChange(next)` wrapper for the
  `Dialog`'s onOpenChange: forwards the flip, and on
  close (cancel / outside-click / Esc) calls
  `resetForm()`.
- Reset is NOT triggered on open — preserves
  re-attempt UX when the user closes accidentally then
  reopens to fix a validation error.
- Successful submit path is unchanged: it both closes
  the dialog AND navigates away, so the unmount handles
  the cleanup naturally. The new reset only runs on
  close-without-submit.

**Key files:** `components/projects/new-project-dialog.tsx`

## V2-M69 — Project page runs list: completed-at copy

**Goal:** M56 rendered every row as "Started X ago". For
COMPLETED runs the user cares more about *when the result
became available* — "Completed 2 hours ago" is the
glanceable signal that determines whether the draft is
still fresh in their mind. Switch the copy when a run has
finished.

**What shipped:**

- Row label is now conditional: `Completed X ago` when
  `r.completedAt` is set, `Started X ago` otherwise.
- The `<time>` element's `dateTime` attribute now points
  at the displayed timestamp (completed vs started) so
  copy-paste + screen-reader UX matches the visible
  copy. Tooltip continues to show the absolute start
  time for full context.
- No data fetch changes — `completedAt` was already
  selected by the existing `runs: { take: 10 }` include.

**Why not also "Failed X ago" for FAILED runs:** the
status pill already reads "failed" + the row links to a
page whose header spotlights the failure reason + the
failed step. Adding a third copy branch would clutter
without adding clarity.

**Key files:** `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`

## V2-M68 — Sanitise OCR artifacts in corpus item titles

**Goal:** M47's `corpusItemLabel` extracted the first
markdown H1/H2 from the parsed PDF as the display title.
Mistral OCR is good but emits artifacts the user
shouldn't see:
  - `**Bold Title**` (markdown emphasis)
  - `$\mathrm{Foo}$` (leftover LaTeX commands from the
    source PDF's typesetting)
  - `"Quoted Title"` (some publishers wrap titles in
    quotes in the PDF metadata)
  - Internal whitespace runs (`Foo    Bar`)

**What shipped:**

- New `sanitiseTitle(raw)` helper alongside
  `corpusItemLabel`:
    - Unwraps inline LaTeX wrappers like `$\mathrm{Foo}$`,
      `${Foo}$`, `$Foo$` — keeps the inner argument.
      Iterates up to 5 passes for nested wrappers,
      capped to defend against pathological input.
    - Strips markdown emphasis (`**bold**`, `*italic*`,
      `__emph__`, `_emph_`, `` `code` ``) — keeps the
      wrapped text.
    - Strips surrounding quotes (straight + curly).
    - Collapses internal whitespace runs to a single
      space.
- `corpusItemLabel` calls the new sanitiser on each
  candidate heading before length-checking — empty
  post-sanitise strings fall through to the next line,
  same as before.
- 6 unit tests cover the emphasis matrix, LaTeX
  wrappers, quote stripping, whitespace collapse,
  clean-title passthrough, and compound input.

**Why iterate the LaTeX unwrap:** real Mistral output
occasionally produces nested patterns like
`**$\textbf{Strong}$**` — a single pass would strip the
LaTeX OR the emphasis but not both. Bounded iteration is
the simplest fix.

**Key files:** `components/corpus/corpus-item-list.tsx`, `tests/components/corpus-item-label.test.ts`

## V2-M67 — Client download links defer to the server filename

**Goal:** M66 made the server emit
`thoth-archaeal-hibernation-2026-05-28.md` Content-
Disposition filenames. But the client `<a download={...}>`
attributes in DraftView + CitationFaithfulnessWidget were
still set to `thoth-${runId}.${ext}` — pre-M66 format.
Same-origin downloads honour Content-Disposition so the
ACTUAL saved filename is correct, but the inconsistency
was confusing + brittle (a later proxy or browser policy
change could surface the client value).

**What shipped:**

- Bare `download` attribute (no value) on all three
  download links — explicitly defers to the server's
  Content-Disposition while still hinting to the
  browser that this is a download, not a navigation.
- Inline comment explaining the choice (so a future
  reader doesn't add the run-id back thinking it's a
  missing prop).

**Key files:** `components/runs/draft-view.tsx`, `components/runs/CitationFaithfulnessWidget.tsx`

## V2-M66 — Human-readable download filenames

**Goal:** The three download routes (M34 draft.md, M35
audit.json, M37 citations.bib) all used filenames of the
form `thoth-<runId>.<ext>`. The run id is opaque to users
(a cuid), so a Downloads folder full of `thoth-cm123...`
files was impossible to triage without opening each. Make
filenames carry the project title + date so they sort +
read sensibly.

**What shipped:**

- New `lib/download-filename.ts` with a `buildRunFilename
  ({ projectTitle, runId, startedAt, suffix })` helper.
  Output: `thoth-<slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.<suffix>`.
- Slug rules (mirroring GitHub / NPM): lowercased,
  non-alphanumeric collapsed to `-`, leading/trailing
  `-` stripped, capped at 60 chars with a word-boundary
  cut so we don't slice mid-word.
- Empty title falls back to the run id (so a title of
  `"!!!"` doesn't render `thoth--2026-05-28.md`).
- Invalid `startedAt` falls back to `unknown-date`
  (defensive against unexpected null bubbling up).
- UTC date components so a server in any TZ produces the
  same filename for the same run.
- Suffix uses a `.` separator so the OS detects the file
  type — `thoth-foo-2026-05-28.md` not `-md`. The two
  multi-extension cases (`audit.json`, `citations.bib`)
  render with their extensions intact.
- All three download routes swapped to use the helper.
  Their existing tests updated to assert the new
  filename format with project title + date.
- 8 new unit tests in `tests/lib/download-filename.test.ts`
  cover: happy slug + date concat, both multi-extension
  suffixes, non-alphanumeric collapse + trim,
  word-boundary truncation, empty-title fallback,
  invalid-date fallback, UTC date stability.

## V2-M65 — Bulk selection helpers on PapersApprovalCard

**Goal:** Symmetric with M64. The V1 papers-approval gate
(the retriever's per-item inclusion verdict) had the same
row-by-row checkbox curation problem.

**What shipped:**

- "Select all" / "Select none" inline buttons next to the
  description copy. Same disabled-when-no-op posture as
  M64. Hidden when there's a single paper (no point).

**Why not also "Only above score X" filter:** the
retriever already scores; the user's job at this gate is
to decide based on the *inclusion reason* the retriever
generated, not raw scores. Adding a score filter would
muddle the mental model. Left as a deliberate omission.

**Key files:** `components/runs/papers-approval-card.tsx`

## V2-M64 — Bulk selection helpers on DiscoveryApprovalCard

**Goal:** The discovery HITL gate ships up to 50 hits at
a time (cost-cap ceiling). Curating that list with a row-
by-row checkbox is tedious — users want common actions:
"keep everything", "drop everything", "only OA URLs"
(paywalled / unknown PDFs are likely to fail at fetch).

**What shipped:**

- "Select all" / "Select none" inline buttons next to
  the "Hits" heading; disabled when the action is a
  no-op (already all/none kept).
- "Only open-access (N)" button — only rendered when
  there's a meaningful mix (`openCount > 0 &&
  openCount < hits.length`). Title-tooltip explains the
  trade-off (paywalled/unknown may fail at fetch).
- Buttons hidden for single-hit lists where bulk
  selection makes no sense.
- All buttons go through the same `setKept(new Set(...))`
  state so the approve handler downstream is unchanged.

**Key files:** `components/runs/discovery-approval-card.tsx`

## V2-M63 — Citation faithfulness widget: breakdown + filter

**Goal:** The widget rendered "8 of 10 citations
supported" — but for the user reviewing the draft, the
*actionable* info is the 2 that aren't supported. With
even a moderate number of citations, scanning a flat
verdicts list for the red rows was tedious.

**What shipped:**

- Breakdown line now also shows UNSUPPORTED + UNCLEAR
  counts in their verdict-coloured spans
  ("8 of 10 citations supported · 1 unsupported · 1
  unclear."). Each count uses the brand
  VERDICT_COLOR palette so they read consistently with
  the panel rows.
- New "Only unsupported / unclear" checkbox visible when
  the verdicts panel is open AND there's at least one
  problematic citation. Defaults off — first interaction
  shows everything (least surprise). When toggled on,
  filters the panel to actionable rows only.
- Filter checkbox auto-hides for fully-clean runs (all
  SUPPORTED) so users on a happy-path draft don't see
  the noise.

**Why no test:** the widget is a client component
without a current jsdom setup; filter is a one-liner
`claimChecks.filter(...)` whose correctness is direct
from the type.

**Key files:** `components/runs/CitationFaithfulnessWidget.tsx`

## V2-M62 — Start-new-run shortcut on FAILED runs

**Goal:** When a run failed, the user had to navigate
back to the project page to start a new run — even
though the only thing the new run needs is the project
id + the same config (already on the project row). The
M51 failed-run panel was a good spotlight, but the next
step ("try again") required leaving the page.

**What shipped:**

- `StartReviewButton` gains `label` + `pendingLabel`
  props so callers can re-use the same component with
  different copy.
- The failed-run panel on the run-detail page now
  embeds the button labelled "Start new run" /
  "Starting new run…". Single click → POST → navigate
  to the new run.
- Same error handling (run-already-active /
  no-PARSED-items / generic) — inherited from the
  shared component.

**Why not a dedicated component:** the API call, error
mapping, and pending-state handling are identical to
the project-page Start button. A label prop is
right-sized vs. a parallel component.

**Key files:** `components/runs/start-review-button.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`

## V2-M60 — Shared `compactCount` formatter helper

**Goal:** Both `TokenSpendBadge` (M36) and the new
`ProjectTokenStat` (M59) implemented their own
"format a token count as 121k / 1.2M" helper. Diverging
behaviour at the M-boundary (token-spend-badge didn't
handle ≥1M; project-token-stat did) waiting to bite
later.

**What shipped:**

- New `lib/format.ts` with a single `compactCount(n)`
  helper. Buckets: <10k locale grouped ("1,234"); 10k..1M
  integer k ("121k"); ≥1M one-decimal M ("1.2M").
  Negatives preserve sign ("-50k"). Non-finite / NaN
  defensively renders as "0".
- Both component callers swapped to the shared helper.
  Local inline `compact` functions deleted.
- 5 unit tests cover the bucket matrix, sign
  preservation, and the non-finite defence.

**Why a defensive non-finite branch:** Prisma's `_sum`
aggregate (used by M59) returns null when there are no
matching rows; the page coalesces with `?? 0`, but if a
future caller forgets the coalesce, `compactCount(null
+ undefined)` would render "NaN" — instead it renders
"0".

**Key files:** `lib/format.ts`, `components/runs/token-spend-badge.tsx`, `components/projects/project-token-stat.tsx`, `tests/lib/format.test.ts`

## V2-M59 — Project-level token aggregate stat

**Goal:** The per-run `TokenSpendBadge` (M36) shows how
close a single run is to MAX_TOKENS_PER_RUN. There was no
project-level counterpart — a user couldn't see "this
whole project has consumed 1.2M tokens across 4 runs"
without manually summing each run's badge.

**What shipped:**

- Project page server query gains a `db.runStep.aggregate
  ({ where: { run: { projectId: id } }, _sum: { ... } })`
  call. Scoped at the project (not just visible runs) so
  the total is correct for projects with >10 runs.
  Single scalar sum query — cheap thanks to FK indexes on
  Run + RunStep.
- New `ProjectTokenStat` component: compact monospace
  badge (`121k tk total`), styled to match the per-run
  badge family but in a neutral stone variant (no
  budget % since there's no project-level cap). Tooltip
  carries the precise breakdown (in / out / cache).
- Compact number formatter handles M / k / raw scales so
  a long-running project doesn't render `1,243,891 tk`
  next to the section heading.
- Auto-hides when billable = 0 so a fresh project
  doesn't render an empty stat.

**Why no test:** the component is presentational
(formatting + conditional render), with the aggregation
done by Prisma's `_sum` (Prisma's own test surface). A
unit test would mostly be tautological.

**Key files:** `components/projects/project-token-stat.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`

## V2-M58 — Delete-run button on run detail page

**Goal:** Mirroring M57 for runs. The list-row Delete
(M40) handled the project-page case. From the run-detail
page itself, the user had to navigate back to the project
list to discard a run — extra friction for a routine op
(testing a flaky run, cleaning up after a deliberate
failure).

**What shipped:**

- `DeleteRunButton` extended with the same `variant`
  +`redirectTo` props pattern from M57's
  DeleteProjectButton:
    - `"list"` (default) — existing project-page row
      styling + `router.refresh()`.
    - `"page"` — always-visible button with hover-
      destructive border + navigates to `redirectTo`
      after a successful delete.
- Run-detail page header gains the button next to the
  status pill, redirecting to the parent project page
  on success.
- Button label upgraded to "Delete run" (was just
  "Delete") so the affordance reads correctly when it
  sits next to other run-page chrome.

**Key files:** `components/runs/delete-run-button.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`

## V2-M57 — Delete-project button on project detail page

**Goal:** Deletion was reachable only via the dashboard
list (M41) — once a user was *on* the project detail page,
they had to navigate back to the dashboard, find the row,
hover-reveal the Delete affordance, and click. Add a Delete
button directly to the project header next to Edit.

**What shipped:**

- `DeleteProjectButton` extended with a `variant` prop:
    - `"list"` (default) — existing dashboard styling
      (hover-revealed link) + `router.refresh()` on
      success.
    - `"page"` — always-visible button with a subtle
      destructive-on-hover border, suitable for header
      bars + navigates to `/dashboard` on success
      (otherwise the user is left on a page that 404s).
- Project page header now renders `<EditProjectDialog />`
  + `<DeleteProjectButton variant="page" />` side by side.

**Why two variants in one component:** the API + state
machine + confirm-copy + error handling are identical;
only the navigation target + visual styling differ. A
boolean / variant prop is right-sized vs. extracting a
hook + re-implementing the markup twice.

**Key files:** `components/projects/delete-project-button.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`

## V2-M56 — Relative-time on project page runs list

**Goal:** Same change as M55 but applied to the project
detail page's runs list. Rows read "5/28/2026, 12:42:33 PM"
— locale-dependent and forces the reader to compute "is
that an hour ago or yesterday?". Switch to the M55
`relativeTime` helper so rows read "Started 4 hours ago".

**What shipped:**

- Runs list rows now render `Started {relativeTime(...)}`
  with the absolute datetime preserved in the `<time>`
  tooltip + `dateTime` attribute.
- Page-level `nowMs` snapshot at the start of the map so
  all rows compute against the same reference clock (no
  one-row-off-by-1 second jitter).

**Key files:** `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`

## V2-M55 — Relative-time "Updated X ago" on dashboard

**Goal:** The dashboard project list eyebrow showed "Updated
28 May 2026" (absolute). For an active project the
glanceable signal is "Updated 2 days ago" / "Updated 4 hours
ago" — easier to triage what needs attention.

**What shipped:**

- New `lib/relative-time.ts` with a `relativeTime(thenMs,
  nowMs, locale?)` helper using `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`
  so locale negotiation works server-side without a
  separate i18n dep.
- Resolution buckets: <60s "just now"; 60s..1h minutes;
  1h..24h hours; 1d..30d days; 30d..365d months; >365d
  years. Future timestamps clamp to "just now" rather
  than rendering "in 3 seconds" (clock skew).
- `numeric: "auto"` for natural singular forms ("1 minute
  ago" / "yesterday" / "1 hour ago").
- `ProjectList` accepts an optional `nowMs` prop. When
  passed (dashboard does), the eyebrow renders relative
  time; when omitted (showcase fixture), falls back to
  absolute date.
- `<time>` tag retains the ISO `dateTime` attribute and
  gains a tooltip `title` with the absolute datetime so
  accessibility tech still surfaces the precise time.
- 4 unit tests (just-now / bucket matrix / numeric:auto
  singular form / future-clock-skew clamp).

**Why server-passed nowMs and not a client effect:**
matches the M43 step-duration pattern. The dashboard
re-renders on every navigation back to it, so the
relative-time copy refreshes naturally; a live-ticking
effect would be overkill for the eyebrow surface.

**Key files:** `lib/relative-time.ts`, `components/projects/project-list.tsx`, `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `tests/lib/relative-time.test.ts`

## V2-M54 — Latest-run pill on dashboard project rows

**Goal:** The dashboard project list showed title + scope
badge + papers/reviews counts. A user with several
projects couldn't tell *at a glance* if a project's most
recent run was completed, mid-flight, or failed — they
had to click into each project to see.

**What shipped:**

- Dashboard query adds
  `runs: { orderBy: { createdAt: "desc" }, take: 1,
    select: { status: true, createdAt: true } }`. Cheap
  thanks to the implicit `[projectId, createdAt]` index
  from the FK + orderBy.
- ProjectList row's title gets a small inline status pill
  rendered via the same `RunStatusPill` the project page
  uses — so the visual language is consistent across the
  dashboard + project-detail surfaces.
- Pill hides when the project has zero runs (a fresh
  project shouldn't read "pending" without context).
- `runs?` on the Project prop is optional for the same
  showcase-fixture forward-compat reason `_count?` was —
  v1-style callers without that data render the existing
  layout unchanged.

**Why "latest" and not a summary:** the M49 RunsBreakdown
already provides a multi-status summary on the project
detail page. On the dashboard, the latest run is the most
actionable signal — "is the thing I started yesterday
done yet" / "did the run I queued before lunch finish".

**Key files:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `components/projects/project-list.tsx`

## V2-M53 — Empty-discovery guidance copy

**Goal:** When the discoverer ran but every adapter
returned zero papers, the DiscoverySummary header still
just read "5 queries ran across the project's configured
providers." with no follow-up — the user didn't know what
to do next.

**What shipped:**

- Empty case now appends actionable guidance to the
  header:
    - If at least one provider errored: "All configured
      providers errored — see the panel below." (points
      at the existing partial-failures panel).
    - Otherwise: "Try broadening the research question,
      widening the year range, or adding more providers
      via Edit project." (recommends the M39
      EditProjectDialog as the action).
- Branch fires only when `queries.length > 0` —
  pre-discovery (no queries yet) shows nothing, since the
  next refresh-tick will reveal the count.

**Why no helper / no test:** the change is two ternaries
in JSX — already-tested upstream signals (queries.length,
providerErrors.length) drive the copy choice.

**Key files:** `components/runs/discovery-summary.tsx`

## V2-M52 — Discovery summary shows per-provider counts

**Goal:** The discovery summary header showed total
discovered papers + screening verdicts but not which
*provider* surfaced them. When the provider-errors panel
flagged a partial failure, the user couldn't tell whether
that failure cost them many or few papers.

**What shipped:**

- New `perProviderCounts()` helper grouping the
  `DiscoveredPaper[]` by provider, sorted by descending
  count (tiebreak: alphabetical label). Returns
  presentation-ready labels so unknown providers don't
  render as their raw enum string.
- `PROVIDER_LABEL` lookup lifted out of the existing inline
  badge map so the helper can reuse it.
- Summary header gains a third caption line:
  `By provider: OpenAlex 12 · arXiv 5 · Exa 3`. Only
  rendered when >1 provider returned papers (a single-
  provider run doesn't need the breakdown).
- 4 unit tests cover counting, descending-with-tiebreak
  ordering, unknown-provider forward-compat, and the
  empty-list base case.

**Why this matters with the partial-failures panel:**
when "arxiv: 429" appears in errors AND "by provider:
OpenAlex 12 · arXiv 0" appears in the summary, the user
sees immediately that the 429 cost the run all of its
arXiv coverage. Pre-this they had to guess.

**Key files:** `components/runs/discovery-summary.tsx`, `tests/components/discovery-summary-counts.test.ts`

## V2-M51 — Surface failed-step name on FAILED runs

**Goal:** When a run failed, the run-detail header just
showed `run.failureReason` as a single line of red text.
The user had to scan the steps list to find which step
blew up. For FAILED runs this is the most important
information on the page — promote it.

**What shipped:**

- The single line of red text becomes a small bordered
  destructive panel containing:
    - The `run.failureReason` (terminal-error copy).
    - A "Failed during: [humanised node name]" caption
      identifying the last step with a `failureReason`,
      using `nodeLabel` for the friendly mapping.
    - When the step's failureReason differs from the
      run-level reason (e.g. extractor failed with "Mistral
      429" but the run's reason was a wrapper message),
      both are shown.
- "Last step with failureReason by startedAt" is the
  heuristic — covers the common case where the terminal
  failure is the outermost step + the inner-per-item case
  where a per-paper step had its own failure that
  bubbled up.

**Why no separate tests:** the change is presentational
(JSX inside the failure branch); existing run-detail
integration tests would need DOM scraping to verify, which
isn't worth standing up jsdom for. The failed-step lookup
is a one-liner over `run.steps` (already test-covered as
a Prisma include).

**Key files:** `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`

## V2-M50 — Per-page tab titles

**Goal:** Every page in the app rendered with the same
"Thoth — Agentic systematic literature reviews" tab title
because only `app/layout.tsx` declared metadata. Users with
several Thoth tabs open had to switch into each tab to know
which project / run it was.

**What shipped:**

- `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx` adds a `generateMetadata`
  that renders `${project.title} — Thoth` as the tab
  title. Existence-probe posture preserved: a missing /
  not-yours project gets "Project not found" instead of a
  richer title.
- `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx` adds a
  `generateMetadata` that renders
  `${project.title} — ${status}` ("GAT review —
  completed", "GAT review — awaiting plan review"). A
  status in the tab title means juggling multiple
  in-flight runs across tabs becomes possible without
  context-switching into each.
- Both fall back to a generic title before owner checks
  complete so an existence-probe can't enumerate other
  users' project / run titles via tab metadata.

**Why no separate tests:** Next.js metadata generation is
tested by Next.js itself; our `generateMetadata` is just
an `await` + a conditional that mirrors the page-handler's
existing posture (which IS test-covered).

**Key files:** `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`

## V2-M49 — Runs section status breakdown

**Goal:** The "Reviews" section on the project page just
showed N rows with status pills. With several runs the
user had to eyeball the pills to know "did anything
complete?" / "is anything still going?". Add a one-line
breakdown above the list.

**What shipped:**

- New `bucketRuns()` helper sorting runs into completed /
  failed / active buckets. REJECTED is grouped with FAILED
  ("didn't produce a draft") rather than its own bucket —
  the project-page summary is about outcomes, not reasons.
- `RunsBreakdown` component renders a tabular-nums caption:
  "2 completed · 3 in progress · 1 failed". Zero-count
  buckets are hidden so a fresh project doesn't read "0
  completed · 0 active · 0 failed". Returns null when all
  buckets are zero.
- Project-page Reviews section header gets the breakdown
  line under the "Reviews" h2 + above the runs list.
- Forward-compat: unknown statuses are silently ignored so
  a future enum member can't render junk.
- 5 unit tests cover mixed buckets, empty list, V2 active
  states, REJECTED grouping, and unknown-status forward
  compat.

**Why bucket from `project.runs` (top 10) rather than
groupBy:** the project page already loads the runs for
the list; reusing the data avoids a second DB round-trip.
For projects with >10 runs the breakdown is "of the 10
most recent" — accurate enough for the at-a-glance
summary the section is meant to provide.

**Key files:** `components/runs/runs-breakdown.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`, `tests/components/runs-breakdown.test.ts`

## V2-M48 — Status pill covers all V2 states + friendlier labels

**Goal:** The `RunStatusPill` component's status union +
variant map were V1-only — missing the four V2 states
(DISCOVERING, AWAITING_DISCOVERY_APPROVAL, FETCHING,
SCREENING). When a V2 run was in any of those states, the
`VARIANT[status]` lookup returned undefined and the Badge
silently fell back to no-variant rendering.

**What shipped:**

- Status union extended with the V2 states.
- Variant map matches V1 visual semantics: processing
  states are "secondary" (subtle), HITL gates "default"
  (prominent).
- New `statusLabel(status)` helper renders friendlier copy
  for the awkward AWAITING_* statuses:
    - `AWAITING_PLAN_APPROVAL` → "awaiting plan review"
    - `AWAITING_PAPERS_APPROVAL` → "awaiting paper review"
    - `AWAITING_DISCOVERY_APPROVAL` → "awaiting discovery
      review"
- Defensive `VARIANT[status] ?? "outline"` fallback at the
  call site so a future-added enum value still renders
  *something* until the map catches up.
- 3 unit tests cover the simple cases, the AWAITING_*
  friendlier mapping, and a compile-time + runtime check
  that every union member produces a non-empty label.

**Key files:** `components/runs/run-status-pill.tsx`, `tests/components/run-status-pill.test.ts`

## V2-M47 — Corpus list shows real paper titles

**Goal:** The corpus list rows showed only `item.source`
— `corpus/<projectId>/<uuid>.pdf` for uploads,
`openalex:W4234567` / `arxiv:2310.06770` for V2 discoveries.
Functional but opaque; you couldn't tell what paper a row
was at a glance.

**What shipped:**

- New `corpusItemLabel(item)` helper. Priority:
    1. First H1/H2 heading line of `parsedMarkdown`
       (Mistral OCR consistently emits the paper title as
       `# Title`). Works for both uploads AND V2 fetched
       papers once OCR'd.
    2. Humanised `source` fallback for items that haven't
       been OCR'd yet (PENDING / PARSING / FAILED): R2 key
       → filename only; `openalex:W123` → "OpenAlex W123";
       `arxiv:2310.06770` → "arXiv 2310.06770"; `exa:url`
       → "Exa url". Unknown prefixes pass through (forward
       compat for new providers).
    3. Long titles >140 chars get truncated with an
       ellipsis so a long DOI/long thesis title doesn't
       blow the layout.
- ItemCard now renders `corpusItemLabel(item)` as the
  primary title (medium-weight) with the raw `source`
  underneath as a small mono caption. Hover-tooltip on
  the title shows the raw source.
- 9 unit tests cover the matrix (5 markdown extraction
  cases, 4 source-fallback cases including unknown
  prefixes).

**Why not also join `discoveredAs.title` from the
DiscoveredPaper table:** the parsedMarkdown heading is the
canonical title once OCR succeeds, and items that haven't
been OCR'd yet still need a fallback anyway. Adding the
DiscoveredPaper join would only catch a brief window after
fetch + before OCR — not worth the query cost.

**Key files:** `components/corpus/corpus-item-list.tsx`, `tests/components/corpus-item-label.test.ts`

## V2-M46 — Dashboard project counts at a glance

**Goal:** The dashboard project list showed title +
question + updated-date but no signal of "how big" each
project was. Users with several projects had to click into
each to learn how many papers + runs were inside.

**What shipped:**

- Dashboard query adds `_count: { select: { corpus: true,
  runs: true } }` — a single Postgres scalar subquery per
  relation, no N+1 fan-out.
- `ProjectList` row renders a small "3 papers · 1 review"
  line below the research-question deck. Tabular-nums
  alignment + stone color so it sits as a quiet third tier
  under the title + question.
- `countsLine` helper handles singular/plural for each
  side independently — "1 paper · 5 reviews", "7 papers ·
  1 review", "0 papers · 0 reviews". 3 unit tests cover
  the matrix.
- `_count` is optional on the type so the showcase project
  built from a v1-shape fixture (and any other v1-style
  caller) can omit it without rendering "undefined".

**Key files:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `components/projects/project-list.tsx`, `tests/components/project-list-counts.test.ts`

## V2-M45 — Corpus-item delete affordance

**Goal:** Users could upload PDFs but couldn't delete
individual corpus items. To remove a wrong-PDF they had to
delete the whole project. Closing this CRUD gap.

**What shipped:**

- New `DELETE /api/corpus/[id]` route. Owner check via
  project FK before delete; 404 (not 403) for not-yours to
  match the existence-probing posture. Cascade behaviour
  spelled out in the route doc:
    - `IncludedPaper` rows cascade-delete (with their
      `ExtractedClaim` + `ClaimCheck` children).
    - `ScreeningDecision.corpusItemId` becomes null
      (SetNull) — the decision row survives.
- `CorpusItemList` ItemCard renders a small inline
  "Delete" button next to the existing actions. Click →
  confirm() spelling out the cascade ("If any review run
  included this paper, its included-paper + extracted-claim
  rows will be deleted with it. The review draft itself
  is preserved.") → DELETE → `router.refresh()`.
- 4 unit tests cover the endpoint (happy / 404 missing /
  404 not-yours / 401 unauthenticated).

**Why allow delete on items used in completed runs:** the
alternative would be to block, forcing the user to
"discard the run, then delete the item" — high friction
for a low-stakes operation in a single-user app. The
confirm() copy spells out the impact instead.

**Key files:** `app/api/corpus/[id]/route.ts`, `components/corpus/corpus-item-list.tsx`, `tests/api/corpus-delete.test.ts`

## V2-M44 — Humanised node-name labels in step timeline

**Goal:** The step list showed raw nodeName values
("planner", "retriever", "discoverer", "fetcher_paper",
"cite_check_citation"). Recognisable to maintainers; opaque
to new users.

**What shipped:**

- New `nodeLabel(nodeName)` helper mapping each agent node to
  a verb-y, present-tense label:
    - planner → "Planning the review"
    - retriever → "Retrieving papers"
    - discoverer → "Discovering outbound papers"
    - fetcher → "Fetching paper metadata"
    - screener → "Screening papers"
    - assessor → "Assessing papers"
    - drafter → "Drafting the review"
    - critic → "Reviewing the draft"
    - cite_check → "Verifying citations"
- Inner per-item nodes (suffix `_paper` / `_citation`) get a
  singular variant so a screen full of "Verifying citation"
  rows reads naturally.
- Forward-compat: unknown nodeNames fall through to the raw
  string (new nodes won't render `undefined`).
- 3 unit tests cover the outer mappings, the inner per-item
  mappings, and the unknown-name fallback.

## V2-M43 — Per-step durations in run timeline

**Goal:** A run takes 5-15 minutes end-to-end and can stall
on any node (Mistral rate limit on extractor, LLM call slow,
search adapter timeout). The step list showed `nodeName` +
token usage + trace link but nothing about *how long* each
step took, so it was impossible to spot a slow step at a
glance.

**What shipped:**

- New `formatStepDuration(ms)` helper with 5 unit tests
  covering: sub-second (1-decimal), 1s..59s (integer), 1m..
  59m (omitting 0s suffix), >=1h (omitting 0m suffix), and
  negative/non-finite clamp to "0s" (wall-clock skew
  shouldn't render "-3s").
- `RunStepList` now renders the duration next to each
  step's token usage. In-progress steps render in Thoth
  blue to signal liveness; completed steps render in the
  default muted color.
- `nowMs` is passed in as a prop rather than computed in
  render — React 19's purity rule blocks impure calls in
  render bodies. The run-detail server page captures
  `Date.now()` once per request; RefreshTick polls every 2s
  so in-progress durations tick up naturally.

**Key files:** `components/runs/run-step-list.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`, `tests/components/run-step-list.test.ts`

## V2-M42 — Live run-status polling on the project page

**Goal:** The run-detail page polls every 2s via `RefreshTick`
so the user sees plan-approval gates, paper-approval gates,
status changes, and step events update in place. The project
page (where the runs list lives) didn't poll, so a user who
kicked off a run and stayed on the project page had to
manually refresh to see status pills move PROCESSING →
AWAITING_PLAN_APPROVAL → AWAITING_PAPER_APPROVAL → COMPLETED.

**What shipped:**

- Refactored `RefreshTick` to delegate to a new
  `RefreshTickList` that polls if *any* of N runs is non-
  terminal. Single-run wrapper preserves the existing API.
- Added `<RefreshTickList runs={...}/>` to the project-page
  runs list so it polls 2s while any visible run is active.
- Visibility-pause + immediate-refresh-on-tab-return
  semantics are inherited from the underlying effect.

**Why not one tick per row:** they'd all share the same
`router.refresh()` (it's the page-level cache, not per-row),
and we'd pay N timers' worth of overhead. Computing
"anyActive" once at the list level is cleaner.

**Why no unit tests:** the polling effect needs jsdom +
react-testing-library to exercise; existing component tests
use server-side `renderToString` which doesn't run effects.
The behavior is verified by the live e2e (which observes
status transitions on the project page).

**Key files:** `components/runs/refresh-tick.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`

## V2-M41 — Delete-project affordance in dashboard

**Goal:** Symmetric with M40. `DELETE /api/projects/[id]`
existed (added in M24) but the only callers were the e2e
test + curl-by-hand. The dashboard project list didn't
surface deletion, so users had to leave the UI to discard a
project.

**What shipped:**

- `DeleteProjectButton` client component (`components/projects/delete-project-button.tsx`)
  — same shape as `DeleteRunButton`: confirm() → DELETE →
  `router.refresh()`. Confirm copy spells out the cascade
  ("every run, paper, claim, and check") since project
  deletion is the most destructive op in the app.
- Project-list row layout: the existing `<Link>` still wraps
  the card content; the delete button is absolutely
  positioned on top, outside the `<Link>` element, so it
  doesn't nest interactive elements (a11y + Safari
  click-bubble safety). `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`
  keeps the editorial dashboard clean until the user mouses
  over a row.

**Key files:** `components/projects/delete-project-button.tsx`, `components/projects/project-list.tsx`

## V2-M40 — Delete-run affordance

**Goal:** Close the Run CRUD gap. POST /api/runs (start), GET
/api/runs/[id] (read), but no DELETE — failed/test runs were
stuck cluttering the project page forever. Add the missing
endpoint + a small UI button per row.

**What shipped:**

- `DELETE /api/runs/[id]` route. Owner-check via project FK
  before delete; 404 (not 403) for not-yours to match the
  existence-probing posture; FK cascade handles the cleanup
  (RunStep, HumanCheckpoint, IncludedPaper, ExtractedClaim,
  ClaimCheck, DiscoveredPaper, ScreeningDecision — all
  onDelete: Cascade pointing at Run).
- `DeleteRunButton` client component (`components/runs/delete-run-button.tsx`)
  — small inline "Delete" affordance with a `confirm()` guard.
  Lives outside the runs-list `<Link>` to avoid nested
  interactive elements.
- Project page run-list layout updated to flex the link + the
  delete button side-by-side. Click → confirm → 204 →
  `router.refresh()` re-fetches the list from the server.
- 4 unit tests cover the DELETE endpoint (happy path / 404
  missing / 404 not-yours / 401 unauthenticated).

**Why a `confirm()` and not a more elaborate confirm dialog:**
the cascade is consequential (every step, checkpoint, included
paper, claim, claim-check is dropped) but reversible only via
restart-from-zero — there's no undo. A browser confirm() is
adequate friction without a heavyweight dialog component.

**Key files:** `app/api/runs/[id]/route.ts`, `components/runs/delete-run-button.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`, `tests/api/runs-delete.test.ts`

## V2-M39 — Edit Project dialog UI

**Goal:** Close the loop on M38. The PATCH endpoint exists; surface
it via an Edit button on the project detail page header.

**What shipped:**

- New `EditProjectDialog` client component
  (`components/projects/edit-project-dialog.tsx`). Mirrors
  `NewProjectDialog`'s field set + UI conventions but:
    - Pre-fills every field from the current project row.
    - POSTs `PATCH /api/projects/<id>` instead of `POST /api/projects`.
    - Submit button reads "Save" not "Create".
    - On success, `router.refresh()` instead of `router.push(...)`
      so the user stays on the project page.
- Project page header gains a flex-row layout: title + question on
  the left, Edit button on the right.
- Why a sibling component instead of reusing NewProjectDialog with
  a mode prop: the create + edit flows diverge in defaulting,
  navigation, and button text; two clear siblings read better than
  a two-mode super-component.

**Key files:** `components/projects/edit-project-dialog.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`

## V2-M38 — PATCH /api/projects/[id] for editing project settings

**Goal:** A real CRUD gap. Users could create + read + delete
projects (POST /api/projects, GET /api/projects/[id], DELETE
/api/projects/[id]) but the only way to change a project's
settings (typo in title, flip scope from uploaded_only to
outbound, switch providers, adjust max-hits) was to delete + start
over. Add the missing PATCH endpoint.

**What shipped:**

- New `PATCH /api/projects/[id]` route. Schema mirrors the POST
  create schema with every field optional + the same Zod refines
  (year-range ordering, maxHits ≤ 100). Auto-defaults providers
  to OpenAlex+arXiv when flipping scope to outbound/hybrid AND the
  caller didn't pass an explicit list AND the row currently has
  no providers — matching the create-time defaulting behavior.
  Owner check via `updateMany({ where: { id, ownerId } })` pushes
  the filter to the DB layer (same atomic pattern as DELETE in
  M24). 404 for unowned/missing, 400 for validation failure,
  401 for unauthenticated.
- 6 new unit tests cover: happy-path update, 404 unowned, 400
  yearStart>yearEnd, provider auto-default branch, explicit-list
  branch skips the default, 401 unauth.

**What still doesn't ship in this milestone (deliberate):** the UI
to surface this endpoint. A future iteration could add an
"Edit project" dialog reusing the NewProjectDialog shape. For now
the API surface is sufficient — power users + MCP-driven flows can
call it directly.

**Key files:** `app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`, `tests/api/projects.test.ts`

## V2-M37 — BibTeX export of included papers

**Goal:** Researchers writing actual literature reviews need to
cite the papers Thoth selected. They can copy DOIs from the
discovery summary manually but that's friction. Add a one-click
BibTeX download to drop straight into their `.bib` file.

**What shipped:**

- New helper `lib/bibtex.ts` with `paperToBibtex` +
  `buildBibtexFile`. Picks `@article` when a DOI is present,
  `@misc` otherwise (the catch-all for arXiv preprints + grey
  literature). Citation keys match the draft's `paper_NNN`
  convention so search-and-replace into LaTeX works directly.
  Title escaping handles `\`, `{`, `}`, `@`. Key sanitisation
  preserves DOI dots but replaces slashes with underscores.
- New route: `GET /api/runs/[id]/citations.bib`. Joins each
  IncludedPaper to its CorpusItem for title (extracted from the
  first `# ` heading in parsedMarkdown) + externalDoi +
  externalArxivId + source. `Content-Disposition: attachment;
  filename="thoth-<id>-citations.bib"`. 404 for no-draft,
  unowned, or missing.
- `DraftView` gains a second "Download .bib" link alongside the
  M34 "Download .md" link. The download trio is now: markdown
  draft (M34) · cite_check audit JSON (M35) · BibTeX citations
  (M37).
- 14 new tests: 9 in `tests/lib/bibtex.test.ts` (every BibTeX
  branch + edge case) + 5 in `tests/api/runs-citations-bib.test.ts`
  (full route shape, no-draft, unowned, unauth, empty-corpus
  comment).

**Key files:** `lib/bibtex.ts`, `app/api/runs/[id]/citations.bib/route.ts`, `components/runs/draft-view.tsx`, `tests/lib/bibtex.test.ts`, `tests/api/runs-citations-bib.test.ts`

## V2-M36 — Token-spend badge on the run-detail page

**Goal:** Researchers on free-tier LLMs care about per-run cost.
The cost-cap (`MAX_TOKENS_PER_RUN`) already enforces a hard
ceiling — but until now there was no UI visibility into where
each run sat relative to that ceiling. A user couldn't tell from
the run-detail page whether a review consumed 5% of the budget
or 95%.

**What shipped:**

- New `TokenSpendBadge` server component
  (`components/runs/token-spend-badge.tsx`). Sums input + output
  tokens across all RunSteps (matching `cost-cap.ts`'s billable
  definition — cache reads excluded, shown separately on hover).
  Renders next to the status pill on the run-detail header.
- Color thresholds: <50% neutral stone · 50–80% gold (heading
  toward the cap) · ≥80% warn brick (close to
  BudgetExceededError).
- Compact format: `121,463` → `121k` to keep the badge from
  ballooning. Full unabbreviated values live in the title
  attribute on hover.
- Run-detail page passes `env.MAX_TOKENS_PER_RUN` (400k default
  per M6) so the percentage reflects whatever the deploy is
  configured for.
- 7 new tests cover: input+output summing, k-suffix formatting,
  cache-token exclusion, warn-color threshold (≥80%), neutral
  threshold (<50%), title-attribute breakdown content, no-cache
  title omission.

**Key files:** `components/runs/token-spend-badge.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`, `tests/components/token-spend-badge.test.ts`

## V2-M35 — cite_check audit JSON download

**Goal:** Parallel to M34. The markdown draft is downloadable;
the cite_check audit (per-claim verdicts + faithfulness score)
deserves the same treatment for downstream analysis. Users with
an MCP client already have this data via `get_citation_audit`;
this gives non-MCP users the same channel.

**What shipped:**

- New route: `GET /api/runs/[id]/audit.json`. Returns the audit
  in the same shape the `get_citation_audit` MCP tool returns
  (reviewId, faithfulnessScore, totalClaims + per-verdict
  counts, claims[]). `Content-Disposition: attachment;
  filename="thoth-<id>-audit.json"`. `Cache-Control: no-store`
  matches the M34 endpoint's behaviour. 404 for "no draft yet"
  (cite_check only runs once the drafter completes), unowned,
  or missing.
- `CitationFaithfulnessWidget` gains an optional `runId` prop +
  renders a "Download .json" link in its header. The showcase
  page intentionally omits `runId` (public exemplar, not the
  user's own data).
- 5 new tests in `tests/api/runs-audit-json.test.ts`: full audit
  shape, no-draft 404, unowned 404, unauthenticated 401, empty
  claimChecks array.

**Key files:** `app/api/runs/[id]/audit.json/route.ts`, `components/runs/CitationFaithfulnessWidget.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`, `tests/api/runs-audit-json.test.ts`

## V2-M34 — Markdown download for the draft

**Goal:** Real UX gap — users can read the draft in the page but
can't keep a copy without copy-pasting. For a research tool whose
output IS the review, that's a significant friction.

**What shipped:**

- New route: `GET /api/runs/[id]/draft.md`. Returns the draft
  markdown as `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="thoth-<runId>.md"`.
  `Cache-Control: no-store` so a re-run's fresh draft isn't masked by
  the browser's cached copy. 404 for "no such run", "not yours",
  or "no draft yet" (same existence-probe defense as the rest of
  the API).
- `DraftView` gains an optional `runId` prop + renders a
  "Download .md" link next to the heading when set. Uses native
  `<a download>` so no client-side state is needed.
- Run-detail page passes `runId` through. The showcase page
  intentionally doesn't — the seeded exemplar is a public
  read-only artifact, not the user's own data to save.
- 4 new tests in `tests/api/runs-draft-md.test.ts` cover: 200
  with correct headers + body, 404 (no draft), 404 (unowned),
  401 (unauthenticated).

**Key files:** `app/api/runs/[id]/draft.md/route.ts`, `components/runs/draft-view.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`, `tests/api/runs-draft-md.test.ts`

## V2-M33 — SSRF defense in the fetcher

**Goal:** The V2 fetcher pulls PDFs from URLs in `DiscoveredPaper.oaUrl`,
which originate in provider responses (OpenAlex / arXiv / Exa). A
compromised or malicious provider response could include URLs
targeting internal services — `http://localhost`, `http://127.0.0.1`,
`http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` (AWS metadata =
IAM-credential leak), RFC 1918 subnets, or non-HTTP schemes
(`file://`, `ftp://`, `gopher://`). Defense-in-depth: validate the URL
shape before calling `fetch()`.

**What shipped:**

- New exported helper `isSafeExternalUrl(url: string): boolean` in
  `lib/agent/nodes/fetcher.ts`. Rejects:
    - Non-HTTP(S) schemes
    - `localhost` / `[::1]` / `127.0.0.0/8` loopback
    - `169.254.0.0/16` link-local (AWS/GCP metadata service)
    - RFC 1918 private subnets (10/8, 172.16-31/12, 192.168/16)
    - The `0.0.0.0` wildcard
    - Malformed URLs (catches the `new URL(url)` throw)
- `downloadPdf()` calls the validator before HEAD — keeps the
  SSRF probe out of the network stack entirely.
- 9 new tests in `tests/lib/agent/nodes/fetcher-ssrf.test.ts`
  covering each rejection class + a few "this IP looks private but
  is NOT actually private" boundary cases (172.15.x.x and 172.32.x.x
  must pass).

**Limits:** This is a defense-in-depth layer, not a full SSRF
fix. A DNS-rebind attack (resolve external first, then internal on
second resolution) would still get through. Vercel's network
isolation handles that case at the infrastructure level; this
helper catches the obvious probe shapes before they even leave the
runtime.

**Key files:** `lib/agent/nodes/fetcher.ts`, `tests/lib/agent/nodes/fetcher-ssrf.test.ts`

## V2-M32 — Hybrid full-pipeline e2e + run-detail API includes V2 surface

**Goal:** Verify M13's hybrid-mode-merges-uploaded-PDFs fix works
end-to-end on the live deploy. The unit tests cover the
synthetic-DiscoveredPaper-wrap logic; this is the live confirmation
that uploaded PDFs actually reach the screener alongside outbound
hits when running through the deployed worker + Mistral free tier.

**What shipped:**

- New live e2e test: `V2 hybrid: uploaded PDF + outbound discovery
  merge into the papers_gate`. Drives a hybrid project — uploads
  short.pdf, waits for PARSED, starts the run with skipDiscoveryGate
  + maxHits=2, approves the plan, then:
    - Asserts the papers_gate fires with an enabled "Approve N"
      button (N≥1 — proves the screener admitted at least one paper
      from EITHER the uploaded synthetic or the outbound hits).
    - Hits `GET /api/runs/<id>` and asserts at least one
      `discoveredPapers[].provider === "uploaded"` row with
      `externalId` starting with `uploaded:` — the M13 invariant
      that hybrid mode wraps PARSED uploads as synthetic
      DiscoveredPaper rows.
    - Rejects to avoid the expensive assessor + cite_check tail
      (the COMPLETED-draft path is covered by M31's test).
- New API surface: `GET /api/runs/<id>` now includes
  `discoveredPapers` (with their `screening` join) — was previously
  fetched separately by the run-detail server component. The new
  shape lets the live test inspect M13 via a single round-trip;
  external clients (MCP, future observability) benefit too.
- 1 new unit test in `tests/api/runs-get.test.ts` locking the
  contract: two-row outbound+hybrid response asserts provider
  widening + screening object-or-null per row.

**Live verification:** Pass (one flaky retry — Mistral RPM blip on
the first attempt, green on retry per playwright IS_LIVE retries=1).

**Key files:** `tests/e2e/live-full-pipeline.spec.ts`, `app/api/runs/[id]/route.ts`, `tests/api/runs-get.test.ts`

## V2-M31 — COMPLETED happy-path + reject-papers e2e

**Goal:** Cover the single biggest user story still untested
against the live deploy: "agent drafts a review + verifies every
cited claim against the source paper." M29's full-pipeline test
stopped at papers_gate to fit inside Mistral free-tier RPM; this
milestone takes it the rest of the way.

**What shipped:**

- New live e2e test: `COMPLETED happy path: V2 outbound all the way
  to draft + cite_check audit`. Drives a V2 outbound run through
  every node — planner → discoverer → fetcher → screener → papers_gate
  → assessor → drafter → critic → cite_check → COMPLETED — then
  reloads the page and asserts:
    - `<article>` / `<main>` heading is visible (react-markdown
      rendered the draft body).
    - cite_check audit copy is visible (supported / unsupported /
      faithfulness / cite_check keywords match the
      CitationFaithfulnessWidget).
  Verified live: **8.1 min** end-to-end against
  `thoth-slr.vercel.app` on Mistral free tier.
- New live e2e test: `V2 outbound: reject papers_gate → REJECTED
  with 'User aborted at papers gate' reason`. Exercises the M12
  papersApproved.rejectionReason path with the
  PapersApprovalCard's hardcoded "User aborted at papers gate"
  string. Verified live: 1.9 min.
- README + home page test-count strings sync to "466 unit + 19
  live (16 fast + 3 full pipeline)" — was bumped again here to
  cover M31's additions (now 23 total).
- README's Roadmap & changelog gains a v2.0.0 entry summarising
  the 31-milestone build + the 10-bug audit pass + the live e2e
  surface.

**Key files:** `tests/e2e/live-full-pipeline.spec.ts`, `README.md`, `app/page.tsx`

## V2-M30 — Rejection-path e2e + Trigger.dev worker redeploy

**Goal:** Per user direction ("all user stories and cases and
workflow are working"): cover the rejection branches at every HITL
gate. Found + fixed a deployment gap along the way.

**What shipped:**

- New test: `reject plan_gate → REJECTED with reason propagated to
  Run.failureReason`. Drives outbound project to plan_gate, clicks
  Reject, types reason, confirms. Asserts REJECTED pill + the
  user's reason on the page (M12 plumbing).
- New test: `V2 outbound: discovery_gate HITL renders + reject →
  REJECTED`. Outbound WITHOUT skipDiscoveryGate. Asserts the
  DiscoveryApprovalCard renders with the discoverer's search
  queries listed, then rejects the discovery sweep.
- Inter-test 30s sleep + planner-wait timeout bumped 120s→240s for
  Mistral free-tier RPM recovery.
- M29's happy-path test scaled back: maxHits 5→2, stops at
  papers_gate (rejects to avoid the expensive assessor→drafter→
  critic→cite_check tail).

**Deployment fix discovered via the new tests:** Existing REJECTED
runs in the DB had `Run.failureReason: null` even though M12 had
been merged. Root cause: Vercel auto-deploys the Next.js app, but
the **Trigger.dev worker is a separate deploy** still carrying
pre-M12 code. User authorised redeploy ("you can redploy it if you
want"); pushed Version 20260527.1. Now M12's failureReason
plumbing actually works in production.

**Memory updated:** `feedback_autonomy_thoth.md` now records that
Trigger.dev redeploys are authorised on Thoth + the
non-interactive deploy command pattern.

**`pnpm test:e2e:live:full`: 3/3 passing** in 11.8 min.

**Key files:** `tests/e2e/live-full-pipeline.spec.ts`, trigger.dev worker (deployed externally)

## V2-M29 — Full agent-pipeline e2e against live deploy

**Goal:** Per user direction ("we are using free llms, so cover
everything"): exercise the complete agent flow including every
LLM-billing node (planner, discoverer, fetcher, screener, etc.)
against the deployed app.

**What shipped:**

- New file `tests/e2e/live-full-pipeline.spec.ts` with a V2
  outbound happy-path test that drives the full agent chain.
- New `pnpm test:e2e:live:full` alias (separate from the standard
  `pnpm test:e2e:live` so the fast smoke stays fast).
- Outbound + skipDiscoveryGate=true + max 2 hits + arXiv only —
  reliably reaches papers_gate in ~50s on Mistral free tier.

**Key files:** `tests/e2e/live-full-pipeline.spec.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, `package.json`

## V2-M28 — Real-user PDF upload in the live e2e

**Goal:** The most user-visible action not yet under live test
coverage was "upload a PDF + see it parse." Add a test that
exercises the entire upload → R2 → CorpusItem PENDING/PARSING
chain against the live deploy.

**What shipped:**

- New auth-walkthrough test: signs in, creates a project, uploads
  `tests/e2e/fixtures/short.pdf` via the UploadButton's hidden
  `<input type="file">`, asserts the corpus item's
  PENDING/PARSING/PARSED badge appears within 30s, then DELETEs
  the project. Does NOT wait for the OCR round-trip to complete —
  the badge appearance is enough proof that the upload + Trigger.dev
  enqueue both worked.
- Pattern mirrors `tests/e2e/upload-flow.spec.ts` (local) but
  pointed at the live deploy with cleanup baked in.

**Per-CI-run cost:** 1 R2 PUT + 1 Mistral OCR (small PDF, free-tier
acceptable) + 1 DB INSERT + 1 DB DELETE. The R2 blob orphans on
cleanup (CorpusItem cascade only drops the DB row, not the blob);
acceptable leak rate at the CI cadence.

**`pnpm test:e2e:live`: 16/16 passing** in 54.7s.

**Key files:** `tests/e2e/live-auth-walkthrough.spec.ts`

## V2-M27 — /sign-in render, 404, network-retry hardening

**Goal:** Round out the e2e to cover the rest of a user's
non-billing surface. Three new tests + one flake-tolerance fix.

**What shipped:**

- New browser-smoke: `/sign-in renders Clerk's SignIn component`.
  Loads /sign-in, waits for Clerk's hydrated email input to be
  reachable (Clerk SDK changes its DOM across releases — assert on
  the lowest-common-denominator input role).
- New browser-smoke: `unknown routes redirect unauthenticated to
  /sign-in (307)`. The proxy middleware's public allowlist is
  small; everything else 307s to Clerk. Verifies the redirect +
  the location header points at sign-in/Clerk.
- New auth-walkthrough: `authenticated 404 page renders with the
  styled custom not-found`. Signed-in user hits a non-existent
  project id; asserts the route returns 404 + the styled
  not-found.tsx renders (the "Back to home" CTA proves the custom
  page, not the default Next.js 404).
- Bug fix in the auth walkthrough: when tests run in serial mode
  the Clerk session persists across tests, so the second `clerk.signIn`
  threw "You're already signed in." Catch the specific
  already-signed-in error and pass through — the desired state is
  the signed-in one, and re-signing-in isn't needed.
- Bump per-test timeout for the auth walkthrough to 120s. Serial-
  mode tests chaining Neon-backed server renders against a Vercel
  deploy hit the 60s default when the deploy is cold-starting.
- `playwright.config.ts` retries=1 in IS_LIVE mode (was 0). Live
  e2e occasionally hits transient ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED /
  ERR_ABORTED from the external network. 1 retry tolerates these
  without polluting CI signal. Local runs keep retries=0 so a
  local flake is still a real bug to investigate.

**`pnpm test:e2e:live`: 15/15 passing** in 39.7s.

**Key files:** `tests/e2e/live-browser-smoke.spec.ts`, `tests/e2e/live-auth-walkthrough.spec.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`

## V2-M26 — Hybrid + tuning + sign-out coverage in the authenticated e2e

**Goal:** Per user direction ("test everything the user can do…
loop until everything in the app is perfect"), keep extending the
authenticated walkthrough to cover the rest of the user's
non-LLM-billing surface.

**What shipped:**

- New test: hybrid scope + every search-tuning knob. Drives:
  searchScope=hybrid, searchYearStart=2020, searchYearEnd=2025,
  searchMaxHits=30, skipDiscoveryGate=true. Verifies the project
  page Discovery configuration panel renders all five values, then
  ROUND-TRIPS through `GET /api/projects/<id>` to confirm the
  values landed in the DB (defends against a UI-render-only
  regression that doesn't persist). Hybrid auto-default providers
  (openalex + arxiv) are asserted in the response.
- New test: sign out via `clerk.signOut`. Asserts the New Project
  button disappears + the public "Sign in" link reappears on
  /. Covers the session-revoke + auth UI flip.
- `pnpm test:e2e:live` total surface: **12/12 passing** in 42.5s
  (3 MCP-transport + 5 public-surface + 4 authenticated).

**Cost per CI run:** 5 DB INSERTs + 5 DELETEs across all four
authenticated tests. No LLM, no OCR, no Trigger.dev work.

**Still NOT covered (intentionally — billing concerns):**
- PDF upload + Mistral OCR (would bill ~$0.001-0.01 per CI run +
  leak the R2 blob on cleanup).
- "Start review" + the agent pipeline (would bill 150-400k LLM
  tokens per run). RELEASING.md's MCP Inspector + Claude Desktop
  manual walkthrough covers this.

## V2-M25 — v2-mode authenticated e2e (create outbound + verify config panel)

**Goal:** Extend M24's authenticated walkthrough with a v2-shape test:
sign in, open New Project, pick **Outbound search**, fill the
question, submit, land on the project page, assert the **Discovery
configuration** panel renders with the picked scope + providers, then
delete to clean up.

**What shipped:**

- New test in `tests/e2e/live-auth-walkthrough.spec.ts`: drives the
  outbound radio button, verifies the provider checkboxes fieldset
  shows ("at least one is required" hint), submits, then asserts
  the project page's v2 panel renders the **Outbound search** scope
  label + the **openalex, arxiv** provider row.
- Viewport set to 1280×1400 for this test because the V2 dialog
  grows tall (radio buttons + provider checkboxes + tuning
  fieldset) and the Create button drops below the default 720px
  fold. Default viewport remains untouched for other tests.
- Cleanup pattern unchanged — afterAll DELETEs via the M24 endpoint;
  the beforeAll defensive sweep now matches "E2E live walkthrough"
  prefix (broader, catches v2 orphans too).
- `pnpm test:e2e:live` total surface: **10/10 passing** (3 MCP +
  5 browser + 2 authenticated walkthroughs).

**Key files:** `tests/e2e/live-auth-walkthrough.spec.ts`

## V2-M24 — DELETE /api/projects/[id] + authenticated live walkthrough

**Goal:** Per user direction ("it's ok add them, to your test and
clean the databases from them afterward"): drive a real authenticated
user through the deployed app, creating real DB rows, then clean
them up. Required a `DELETE /api/projects/[id]` endpoint that didn't
exist — users had no way to delete projects from anywhere.

**What shipped:**

- `DELETE /api/projects/[id]` in `app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`.
  Uses `db.project.deleteMany({ where: { id, ownerId } })` so the
  owner check happens at the DB layer atomically; cascade-deletes
  every owned row (CorpusItem, Run, HumanCheckpoint, IncludedPaper,
  ExtractedClaim, ClaimCheck, DiscoveredPaper, ScreeningDecision)
  via the existing `onDelete: Cascade` foreign keys. 204 on
  success; 404 (not 403) when not found or not owned, matching the
  rest of the API's existence-probe defense.
- 3 unit tests for the route: 204 on owned, 404 on
  unowned/missing, 401 unauthenticated.
- New `tests/e2e/live-auth-walkthrough.spec.ts`: signs in via Clerk
  testing token, opens the New Project dialog, creates a project
  on the live deploy, asserts the project page renders, then
  DELETEs it and verifies it's gone from the dashboard. Auto-skips
  when CLERK_SECRET_KEY / E2E_EMAIL aren't set so CI runs without
  prod credentials still pass.
- Defensive `beforeAll` cleanup sweep: enumerates the test user's
  projects and deletes any whose title starts with the test's
  prefix, so an orphan from a previous crashed run gets swept up
  next time.
- `afterAll` belt-and-braces cleanup deletes anything the in-test
  cleanup missed.
- README test row + RELEASING.md MCP-smoke checklist updated to
  reflect the 9-test live suite.

**Why this matters:** an authenticated walkthrough exercises the
real `requireUser` middleware, real Clerk OAuth, real Postgres
writes, real cascade-delete on a project + its (about-to-exist)
children. The earlier 8 tests were public-surface only — this is
the first e2e that proves the auth-gated UI actually works against
the deployed instance.

**Cost:** ~3 DB INSERTs + 3 DELETEs per CI run. No LLM tokens,
no Trigger.dev enqueue, no Mistral OCR.

**Key files:** `app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`, `tests/api/projects.test.ts`, `tests/e2e/live-auth-walkthrough.spec.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, `package.json`

## V2-M23 — Live-deploy real-browser e2e smoke

**Goal:** The existing `pnpm test:e2e:live` only exercised the MCP
transport (3 API-level checks). User asked for a "real user in a
browser against the deployed version" check too.

**What shipped:**

- New `tests/e2e/live-browser-smoke.spec.ts` (5 tests, all run in
  a real Chromium under Playwright against
  `https://thoth-slr.vercel.app`):
    1. Home page renders the headline + a primary CTA.
    2. `/api/health` returns `{ ok: true, dbReachable: true,
       commitSha: <git sha> }`.
    3. `/evals` dashboard renders with at least one metric tile.
    4. `/showcase` renders the seeded exemplar (or `test.skip` if
       the deploy hasn't run `pnpm seed:showcase` yet).
    5. `/.well-known/security.txt` serves per RFC 9116.
- `playwright.config.ts` `IS_LIVE` projects' testMatch widens to
  `(mcp-smoke|live-browser-smoke).spec.ts`.
- `package.json` `test:e2e:live` alias adds the new spec to the
  test list.
- README test row updates to "463 unit/integration + 8 live e2e
  (3 MCP-transport + 5 real-browser)".
- `RELEASING.md` MCP-smoke checklist references the 8-test surface.

**What this does NOT cover (intentionally):**

- Authenticated flows (create project, start a run, the v2 outbound
  pipeline end-to-end). Those need a real Clerk session, would
  write to prod, and would bill Mistral + LLM tokens per CI run.
  RELEASING.md's manual MCP Inspector + Claude Desktop walkthrough
  covers them.

## V2-M22 — segmentStatus is V2-aware (DISCOVERING/FETCHING were dead enums)

**Goal:** Tenth audit fix. The Run.status enum declared
`DISCOVERING`, `FETCHING`, `SCREENING` (added in the v2 migration)
but the trigger task's `segmentStatus()` always returned the V1
chain (PLANNING/RETRIEVING/ASSESSING/DRAFTING). Outbound runs
displayed `RETRIEVING` while the discoverer / fetcher / screener
were actually running — misleading on the dashboard status pill
and on `list_reviews` MCP output.

**What shipped:**

- `segmentStatus(segment, searchScope)` now takes the project's
  searchScope. uploaded_only keeps the V1 chain. outbound + hybrid
  return PLANNING → DISCOVERING → FETCHING → ASSESSING → DRAFTING.
- Trigger task call site passes `project.searchScope` through.
- New test asserts an outbound run's setRunStatus call sequence
  contains DISCOVERING + FETCHING + ASSESSING and crucially does
  NOT contain V1's RETRIEVING.

**Key files:** `trigger/run-review.ts`, `tests/trigger/run-review.test.ts`

## V2-M21 — Dispatcher all-providers-fail coverage + README v2 quickstart

**Goal:** Two small finishes.

**What shipped:**

- New dispatcher test: when EVERY configured provider rejects (network
  timeout / 503 / missing API key on the same run), `dispatchSearch` must
  return `{hits: [], errors: [...all three...]}` and NOT throw. An uncaught
  rejection here would crash the discoverer node and the whole run; the
  empty-hits-with-error-log shape lets the run gracefully end at the
  discovery_gate with the user seeing "0 papers found, here's why."
- README gains a "Trying the v2 outbound flow" subsection under
  Quickstart — 7-step walkthrough from sign-in through screener verdict,
  plus a note on the skipDiscoveryGate power-user option and the V2 MCP
  introspection tools.

**Key files:** `tests/lib/search/dispatch.test.ts`, `README.md`

## V2-M20 — Discovered-paper click-through links + author display

**Goal:** When users see a discovered paper in the DiscoverySummary
panel, the title was inert text. They had to copy the externalId
and paste it into a new tab to actually read the paper. Polish gap.

**What shipped:**

- New `lib/search/external-link.ts` with `externalPaperLink({ provider,
  externalId, oaUrl })` mapping each provider's externalId shape to a
  human-readable URL:
    - `arxiv:2310.06770`   → `https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06770`
    - `10.1038/s41586-...` → `https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-...`
    - `openalex:W12345`    → `https://openalex.org/W12345`
    - exa hits fall back to `oaUrl` when present
    - `uploaded:ci_a` returns null (no external link — it's a user upload)
- `DiscoverySummary` (run-detail panel) renders the paper title as an
  `<a href target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">` when
  `externalPaperLink` returns a URL, falling back to a plain `<p>`
  otherwise. The author list (first 5, "+ N more" tail) also shows
  now — previously the field was loaded but never rendered.
- 7 new tests for `externalPaperLink` covering each provider shape +
  the uploaded null case + the unknown-shape fallback + the
  "don't mistake bare arxiv id for a DOI" edge case.

**Key files:** `lib/search/external-link.ts`, `components/runs/discovery-summary.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`, `tests/lib/search/external-link.test.ts`

## V2-M19 — SEARCH_DISABLED fail-fast at runs-start

**Goal:** When the operator flips `SEARCH_DISABLED=1` (the v2 kill
switch from M2c), outbound/hybrid projects could still start a
run from the UI. The planner would then run + bill ~2k LLM tokens,
the plan_gate would interrupt + bill HITL latency, and only THEN
the discoverer would throw with the SEARCH_DISABLED message — at
which point the user has paid for half a planning round. Lousy
fail-mode UX + wasted spend.

**What shipped:**

- `/api/projects/[id]/runs` now reads `env.SEARCH_DISABLED` and,
  when set, returns **503 search_disabled** with a clear
  user-readable message for outbound/hybrid scope. The Run row is
  never created, no Trigger.dev task is enqueued, no LLM tokens
  are billed.
- uploaded_only projects still start normally — they don't touch
  the search providers, so the kill-switch doesn't apply to them.
- Two new tests cover the 503 path for outbound and the
  pass-through for uploaded_only when `SEARCH_DISABLED=1`.

**Key files:** `app/api/projects/[id]/runs/route.ts`, `tests/api/runs-start.test.ts`

## V2-M18 — Multi-tenant unique-constraint fix

**Goal:** Eighth audit bug. `CorpusItem.externalDoi` and
`externalArxivId` were declared `@unique` (globally unique) in the M0
migration. Effect: once any user's project fetched paper-X
(DOI="10.1/foo"), every OTHER user's outbound run that surfaced the
same paper crashed on a unique-constraint violation when the
fetcher tried to create the CorpusItem. Multi-tenant outbound was
broken — second user just couldn't get paper-X into their corpus,
ever.

**What shipped:**

- New migration
  `20260527220000_v2_corpus_xref_per_project/migration.sql`:
  `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "CorpusItem_externalDoi_key"`,
  `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "CorpusItem_externalArxivId_key"`,
  then create `(projectId, externalDoi)` + `(projectId, externalArxivId)`
  compound unique indexes. Migration is strictly less restrictive
  than the previous global unique, so the apply is safe regardless
  of existing data.
- `prisma/schema.prisma` reflects the new constraint via
  `@@unique([projectId, externalDoi])` / `@@unique([projectId,
  externalArxivId])` (the field-level `@unique` was removed).
- Prisma client regenerated; no other code change needed (the
  fetcher's create call passes `projectId` already, so the
  per-project uniqueness Just Works).

**Key files:** `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/migrations/20260527220000_v2_corpus_xref_per_project/migration.sql`

## V2-M17 — Screener retry idempotency

**Goal:** Seventh audit bug, found by walking the screener loop one
more time. The screener processes up to 50 DiscoveredPapers
sequentially (Mistral free-tier RPS budget). If paper 25/50 hit a
rate-limit, the run died — but the first 24 already had
ScreeningDecision rows persisted. A Trigger.dev retry would crash
on the FIRST already-screened paper because `db.screeningDecision.
create({ data })` doesn't check for existing rows and
`ScreeningDecision.discoveredPaperId` is `@unique`.

**What shipped:**

- The screener now loads existing `ScreeningDecision` rows for the
  current `runId` at the top of the node, builds a `Map<discoveredPaperId,
  decision>`, and seeds the in-memory `decisions[]` + `included[]`
  accumulators from the cached rows. For each paper, if it's
  already in the map, the LLM call + `screeningDecision.create` are
  both skipped. Net result: the second attempt only LLM-calls the
  papers that hadn't been decided yet, and the create call's unique
  constraint never fires.
- IncludedPaper specs are rebuilt from the cached decisions too
  (subject to the same `include && corpusItemId` invariant as fresh
  runs).
- One new test: pre-populate
  `db.screeningDecision.findMany` with paper "a", drive the screener
  on `[a, b]`, assert (1) `runLLM` called exactly once (for b only),
  (2) `screeningDecision.create` called exactly once (for b only),
  (3) returned state includes both decisions (cached a + fresh b),
  (4) both papers materialize IncludedPaper rows.

**Key files:** `lib/agent/nodes/screener.ts`, `tests/lib/agent/nodes/screener.test.ts`

## V2-M16 — Hybrid cross-source dedup

**Goal:** Edge case turned up while auditing hybrid mode: if a user
had uploaded paper-X (so `CorpusItem.externalDoi="10.1/foo"`) AND
the outbound search ALSO surfaced paper-X via OpenAlex with
`externalId="10.1/foo"`, the discoverer would persist BOTH as
separate `DiscoveredPaper` rows. The screener would evaluate both,
the assessor would extract claims from both, and the drafter could
cite the same paper twice (once as the upload, once as the OCR'd
download). Subtle but real bug in hybrid mode.

**What shipped:**

- The discoverer's hybrid branch now reads
  `CorpusItem.externalDoi` + `externalArxivId` (the same columns
  the fetcher populates) for every PARSED upload BEFORE persisting
  outbound hits. Any outbound hit whose externalId matches an
  uploaded DOI or `arxiv:<id>` is dropped before the createMany.
  Uploads always win — they already have parsedMarkdown + summary,
  no re-fetch needed.
- One new discoverer test asserts the dedup: outbound returns 3
  hits (two duplicate, one new), uploads cover the two duplicates,
  the outbound createMany ends up with just the "genuinely new"
  one while both uploads still get wrapped as synthetic rows.

**Key files:** `lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.ts`, `tests/lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.test.ts`

## V2-M15 — Honor papersApproved.corpusItemIds (V1 bug found in V2 audit)

**Goal:** Fifth audit bug, and the oldest one of the five — exists
since V1's papers_gate landed. The PapersApprovalCard's per-row
checkbox sent `corpusItemIds` (the still-kept list) to the approve
endpoint, the approve endpoint persisted it on
HumanCheckpoint.decisionPayload, the trigger task ran the resume —
and then **no node ever filtered against it**. Unchecking a paper at
papers_gate did nothing. The assessor processed every paper, the
drafter cited every paper, the user's intent vanished. Same shape of
silent-no-op as keptExternalIds (M11) and skipDiscoveryGate (M14).

**What shipped:**

- `papersApprovalGate` in `lib/agent/graph.ts` now reads the
  resume decision's `corpusItemIds` (when present + approved) and
  filters `state.includedPapers` to that set before the assessor
  runs. The filter applies whether the includedPapers came from
  V1's retriever or V2's screener; both flow through the same
  shared gate.
- One new end-to-end graph test: retriever produces three included
  papers (c1, c2, c3), the user's resume payload says
  `corpusItemIds: ["c1", "c3"]`, assessor mock captures the
  includedPapers it actually sees, assert it sees only c1+c3.

**Key files:** `lib/agent/graph.ts`, `tests/lib/agent/graph.test.ts`

## V2-M14 — Wire Project.skipDiscoveryGate (was declared, never honored)

**Goal:** Fourth v2 audit bug. `Project.skipDiscoveryGate` has existed
as a column since the M0 migration (defaulted false, called out in the
spec as a power-user opt-out from the HITL gate) but no code consumed
it. Every outbound run paused at discovery_gate regardless of the
column's value — the field was pure dead schema.

**What shipped:**

- `AgentState.skipDiscoveryGate` channel added (boolean, default
  false, "neu wins" reducer like the other v2 channels).
- `trigger/run-review.ts` hydrates it from `Project.skipDiscoveryGate`
  alongside the other v2 fields.
- `lib/agent/graph.ts` discoveryApprovalGate short-circuits when
  `state.skipDiscoveryGate=true`: returns `{ approved: true }`
  directly without calling `interrupt()`, so the graph flows
  straight from discoverer → fetcher with no HITL pause. The
  fetcher + screener + cost-cap chain still applies, so this can't
  cause a runaway-cost incident on its own.
- `app/api/projects/route.ts` create schema accepts the new
  optional `skipDiscoveryGate` field.
- `NewProjectDialog` "Search tuning" fieldset gains a "Skip
  discovery approval" checkbox with explainer copy.
- Project detail page surfaces the setting in the Discovery
  configuration panel ("HITL gate: Discovery approval skipped").
- `tests/lib/agent/graph.test.ts` gets a new end-to-end case
  ("V2 outbound: skipDiscoveryGate=true auto-approves and flows
  straight to fetcher") that drives a full outbound run with only
  two Command.resume calls (plan_gate + papers_gate, none for
  discovery_gate) and asserts the draft is produced.

**Key files:** `lib/agent/state.ts`, `lib/agent/graph.ts`, `trigger/run-review.ts`, `app/api/projects/route.ts`, `components/projects/new-project-dialog.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`, `tests/lib/agent/graph.test.ts`

## V2-M13 — Hybrid mode actually merges uploaded PDFs (bug fix)

**Goal:** Hybrid projects (`searchScope='hybrid'`) required ≥1 PARSED
corpus item at runs-start but the graph routed them straight to the
discoverer (never the retriever), so uploaded PDFs were dead in the
water — the screener never saw them, the assessor never saw them,
the user's uploads were silently dropped.

**What shipped:**

- After the search-provider dedup, the discoverer now also
  enumerates `PARSED` `CorpusItem` rows for the project and wraps
  each as a synthetic `DiscoveredPaper` row with
  `provider="uploaded"`, `externalId="uploaded:${corpusItem.id}"`,
  `initialScore=1.0` (user upload = strong prior), and
  `corpusItemId` pre-set so the fetcher's idempotency check skips
  the OCR step. Title is heuristic: first markdown heading > the
  source's filename > the corpus id.
- The screener (which iterates `state.discoveredPapers`) now sees
  uploaded + outbound papers in one pass and emits IncludedPaper
  rows for either source when its verdict is include=true.
- `DiscoveredPaperRef.provider` type widens to include `"uploaded"`.
  `PROVIDER_BADGE` in DiscoverySummary + DiscoveryApprovalCard
  picks up the new value so uploaded papers render with an
  "Uploaded" tag instead of the raw provider name.
- Two new discoverer tests: hybrid mode wraps PARSED uploads as
  synthetic rows (asserting provider/externalId/title/abstract
  shape); outbound mode does NOT call corpusItem.findMany at all
  (so V1 / pure-outbound semantics are unchanged).

**Key files:** `lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.ts`, `lib/agent/state.ts`, `components/runs/discovery-summary.tsx`, `components/runs/discovery-approval-card.tsx`, `tests/lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.test.ts`

## V2-M12 — Rejection-reason plumbing (bug fix)

**Goal:** Two bugs surfaced while auditing V2 critical paths. Both
were silent UX losses.

**What shipped:**

- `trigger/run-review.ts` now handles `discoveryApproved.approved=false`
  symmetrically with planApproved + papersApproved. Before this fix,
  rejecting the discovery_gate ended the graph at END with no draft,
  and the trigger task fell through to the "no draft → FAILED" path
  — mis-classifying user rejection as agent failure. Status now
  goes to REJECTED, matching the V1 plan / papers rejection
  behaviour.
- `setRunStatus()` gains an optional `failureReason` arg. All three
  rejection paths (plan, discovery, papers) now persist the user's
  rejection reason from the HumanCheckpoint to Run.failureReason,
  so the run-detail page's existing `run.failureReason && <p>`
  block actually surfaces "Why is this run REJECTED?" instead of
  staying empty.
- 1 new test in `tests/trigger/run-review.test.ts` covers the
  discovery rejection path end-to-end; the existing plan-rejection
  test was strengthened to assert failureReason propagation.

**Key files:** `trigger/run-review.ts`, `lib/agent/runs.ts`, `tests/trigger/run-review.test.ts`

## V2-M11 — Honor keptExternalIds in fetcher (bug fix)

**Goal:** Make the DiscoveryApprovalCard's per-row checkbox actually
do something. Before this fix, the fetcher and screener looped over
every discovered paper regardless of which ones the user dropped
at the discovery_gate — quietly negating the user's intent and
costing OCR + screener-LLM calls on rejected papers.

**What shipped:**

- `lib/agent/nodes/fetcher.ts` reads `state.discoveryApproved.
  keptExternalIds` and filters discoveredPapers to that list (when
  provided) before the open-access / OCR / persistence loop. When
  the user clicked "Approve N" without dropping anything, the field
  is undefined and the original "fetch all" behaviour stands.
- The returned state's `discoveredPapers` shrinks to the kept set
  so the downstream screener (which iterates state.discoveredPapers)
  never bills LLM calls on dropped papers either.
- The underlying `DiscoveredPaper` DB rows are NOT deleted — they
  still appear in `list_discovered_papers` (MCP tool) and the
  DiscoverySummary panel, so users + auditors can see "the
  discoverer found 50, you kept 30, the screener admitted 12."
- Two new fetcher tests cover the keptExternalIds path (only kept
  papers fetched + only kept papers in returned state) and the
  approved-as-is path (keptExternalIds undefined → every paper
  fetched).

**Key files:** `lib/agent/nodes/fetcher.ts`, `tests/lib/agent/nodes/fetcher.test.ts`

## V2-M10 — Eval CLI + dashboard wire V2 metrics

**Goal:** Make the public `/evals` dashboard ready for V2 outbound
goldens the moment one lands, without a separate code change.

**What shipped:**

- `lib/eval/golden-schema.ts` gains optional
  `expectedDois: string[]` field (turns out the earlier M3a milestone
  documented this but never actually committed the schema change —
  the previous compaction summary recorded code that wasn't on disk).
  Now properly committed with 3 schema tests covering present /
  absent / too-short cases.
- `scripts/run-evals.ts` imports `discoveryRecall` +
  `screeningPrecision`, computes both when the golden has
  `expectedDois` AND the run produced `discoveredPapers`.
  V1 goldens leave `expectedDois` undefined, so the V1 metric set
  emits unchanged — no vacuous-true 1.00 rows polluting the
  dashboard.
- `MetricRow` type widened with the two new metric names.
- `/evals` page METRICS array gains "Discovery recall (v2)" +
  "Screening precision (v2)" tiles. Aggregate stays per-metric so
  a v2-mode golden's data won't show until it actually lands.
- EvalRun schema comment updated to mention the new metric names.

**Key files:** `scripts/run-evals.ts`, `app/evals/page.tsx`, `lib/eval/golden-schema.ts`, `tests/lib/eval/golden-schema.test.ts`

## V2-M9 — Run-detail discovery summary

**Goal:** Make a v2 run legible at a glance — what queries ran, what
papers turned up, how the screener voted, which providers failed —
without users having to install an MCP client to read it.

**What shipped:**

- New `DiscoverySummary` server component
  (`components/runs/discovery-summary.tsx`) — renders queries +
  discovered-papers list (provider badge, year, initial score,
  fetched + screening verdict + reason) + a per-provider error
  panel that surfaces partial failures inline (e.g. "exa: missing
  API key") instead of burying them in `RunStep.failureReason`.
- Run-detail page (`app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`):
  fetches `discoveredPapers` (with their `screening` join) in the
  same query that loads the run; renders an `outbound` / `hybrid`
  badge in the run header; mounts the DiscoverySummary panel for
  outbound runs (gated to only render once queries OR discovered
  papers exist so v1 runs and freshly-started v2 runs aren't
  cluttered).
- Same source-of-truth as the V2 MCP tools: queries come from the
  APPROVE_DISCOVERY checkpoint's proposal; provider errors come
  from RunStep where nodeName='discoverer'.

**Key files:** `components/runs/discovery-summary.tsx`, `app/projects/[id]/runs/[runId]/page.tsx`

## V2-M8 — Search tuning surface (year range + max-hits in the create dialog)

**Goal:** Expose the search-tuning knobs the API already accepted but
the UI didn't surface, so power users can pick year range + max-hits
at project-create time without having to hit the API directly.

**What shipped:**

- `app/api/projects/route.ts` create schema gains optional
  `searchMaxHits` (Zod: int 1-100). Year range was already on the
  schema; this commit's tests are the first to assert the
  `yearStart > yearEnd` refine actually fails closed.
- `NewProjectDialog` grows a "Search tuning (optional)" fieldset
  (visible only when scope ≠ uploaded_only) with year-start, year-end,
  and max-hits number inputs. Empty fields = "use the server default"
  (the parsed values are skipped if NaN). Caption explains the
  free-tier cost trade-off.
- `tests/api/projects.test.ts` gains four new tests: outbound with
  explicit providers + year range + max-hits, outbound-without-providers
  auto-defaulting to OpenAlex+arXiv, yearStart>yearEnd → 400,
  searchMaxHits above the 100 ceiling → 400. (The first two were
  live code paths from M2c with no test coverage; backfilling now.)

**Key files:** `app/api/projects/route.ts`, `components/projects/new-project-dialog.tsx`, `tests/api/projects.test.ts`

## V2-M7 — Project-level V2 visibility + outbound start gate

**Goal:** Make a v2-configured project legible from the UI and let
outbound projects start a review without a pre-uploaded corpus.

**What shipped:**

- Project detail page (`app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`) gains a
  "Discovery configuration" panel for outbound + hybrid projects:
  scope label, provider list, max-hits cap, optional year range.
  Uploaded_only projects render identically to V1 (the panel is
  hidden) so V1 users see no change.
- `canStartReview` branches on `project.searchScope`. Outbound
  projects no longer need a parsed corpus item before the
  start-review button is clickable — the discoverer builds the
  corpus itself. Hybrid still requires uploads (matches the existing
  runs-start API guard).
- "No reviews yet" hint copy is scope-aware: outbound projects get
  "Start one — the agent will discover candidate papers, screen
  them…" instead of V1's "once at least one paper is parsed".
- Project list (`components/projects/project-list.tsx`) renders a
  small `v2` (outbound) / `hybrid` badge next to the title so users
  can spot mode at a glance on the dashboard.
- runs-start route gains three new tests covering outbound (corpus
  check skipped), outbound-without-providers (409), and hybrid with
  empty corpus (409 with the hybrid-shaped message).

**Key files:** `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`, `components/projects/project-list.tsx`, `tests/api/runs-start.test.ts`

## V2-M6 — Cost-cap safety knobs (per-spec §7)

**Goal:** Implement the cost-cap knobs the v2 design promised so a
runaway outbound run can't blow the OCR + screener budget.

**What shipped:**

- `MAX_TOKENS_PER_RUN` default bumped 250k → 400k. V1 took ~150k for
  assessor/drafter/critic/cite_check; v2 adds discoverer + per-paper
  screener calls + OCR overhead. Per-env override unchanged.
- New `MAX_DISCOVERED_PAPERS_PER_RUN` env knob (default 50, ceiling
  100, Zod-validated). After dedup, the discoverer sorts by
  initialScore DESC and slices to `min(env_cap, project.searchMaxHits)`
  before persisting, so the fetcher loop never sees more than the
  configured ceiling. Per-project `searchMaxHits` (already on the
  Project model from M0) wins when tighter than the env cap; the env
  cap wins when the project asked for more (operator wins).
- `AgentState.searchMaxHits` added to plumb the per-project value;
  `trigger/run-review.ts` hydrates it alongside searchScope +
  searchProviders.

## V2-M5 — MCP introspection for V2

**Goal:** Bring V2 capability into the MCP surface so external clients
(claude.ai, Cursor, Claude Desktop) can inspect outbound runs the same
way they inspect V1 reviews.

**What shipped:**

- `list_discovered_papers(reviewId)` — every paper the discoverer
  surfaced for an outbound run, plus per-paper fetch status + screener
  verdict + initial relevance score. Returns empty + searchScope hint
  for uploaded_only runs.
- `get_search_queries(reviewId)` — LLM-generated search queries
  (sourced from the APPROVE_DISCOVERY checkpoint's proposal),
  provider set, and per-provider error log from RunStep.
- Updated `tests/lib/mcp/tools-annotations.test.ts` + `mcp-route.test.ts`
  to assert the 5-tool surface.
- `docs/mcp/tools.md` + README MCP tool list updated.

**Key files:** `lib/mcp/tools/list-discovered-papers.ts`, `lib/mcp/tools/get-search-queries.ts`, `lib/mcp/tools/index.ts`, `tests/lib/mcp/tools/{list-discovered-papers,get-search-queries}.test.ts`, `docs/mcp/tools.md`

## V2-M4 — Docs sync + ceremony

**Goal:** Make the V2 capability legible to anyone landing in the README
+ cement the build narrative.

**What shipped:**

- README updated with the V2 mode overview ("Outbound search (v2, new)").
- README "What makes Thoth different" gets a new ribbon for outbound
  web search.
- Status row in the engineering-proofs table updated to mention v2.0.
- This roadmap doc (`thoth-v2-roadmap.md`) lands as the canonical
  shipping log.
- `thoth-v2-design.md` Status flipped from DRAFT to "Shipped".

## What stays deferred

Open V2-spec items that didn't ship in v2.0:

- **Real v2-mode goldens** + `EVAL_MODE=outbound` CI path. The metrics
  + schema field are wired *and* `lib/eval/headless-runner.ts` now
  accepts `searchScope` + `searchProviders` so callers can drive an
  outbound run end-to-end through the eval harness with an empty
  corpus. What's still missing is the YAML inputs themselves — picking
  goldens with verifiable arXiv DOIs that aren't trivial to surface
  needs maintainer judgement. The framework is ready to consume them.

(Query-editing in the discovery_gate UI — once listed here — shipped in
V2-M113: edit the queries in place + re-run the discoverer.)
