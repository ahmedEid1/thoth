# Thoth v2 build roadmap

Per-milestone shipping log for V2 outbound search. The full spec is at
[`docs/superpowers/specs/thoth-v2-design.md`](../specs/thoth-v2-design.md);
V1's milestone log is at [`thoth-roadmap.md`](./thoth-roadmap.md).

Each milestone landed as a series of small commits on master with the
`v2-m{0..4}{a..d}` prefix on commit messages. Vercel auto-deployed every
push and the additive Prisma migrations ran on Neon at build time — V1
projects continue to route through the uploaded-only path unchanged.

## V2-M0 — Schema + adapter scaffolding

**Goal:** Lay down the data model + provider-interface contract without
touching the agent.

**What shipped:**

- Spec doc at `docs/superpowers/specs/thoth-v2-design.md`.
- Prisma migration `20260527190000_add_v2_outbound_search`:
  enum `SearchScope` (uploaded_only / outbound / hybrid); `Project`
  gains searchScope + searchProviders + year-range + skipDiscoveryGate
  (all defaulted to V1-equivalent values); `CorpusItem` gains optional
  `externalDoi` + `externalArxivId` cross-references; new tables
  `DiscoveredPaper` + `ScreeningDecision`.
- `lib/search/types.ts` + stubbed adapters under `lib/search/providers/`
  for OpenAlex / arXiv / Exa, plus the `dispatchSearch` fan-out with
  per-provider error isolation + score-max dedup.

**Key files:** `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/migrations/20260527190000_add_v2_outbound_search/`, `lib/search/{types,dispatch}.ts`, `lib/search/providers/{openalex,arxiv,exa}.ts`

## V2-M1 — Real adapters + agent nodes

**Goal:** Make the outbound pipeline runnable end-to-end behind a feature
toggle.

**What shipped (m1a-m1d):**

- **OpenAlex** adapter — `lib/search/providers/openalex.ts` with abstract
  rebuild from the inverted index, year-range filtering via the
  documented `from_publication_date` / `to_publication_date` filters,
  DOI-first canonical externalId for cross-provider dedup, BM25-score
  normalization into [0,1].
- **arXiv** adapter — regex-based Atom XML parser (`parseArxivAtom`
  exported for unit tests), version-suffix normalization so `v1`/`v2`/`v3`
  of the same preprint dedup, DOI cross-reference when arXiv exposes one,
  always-OA accessStatus.
- **discoverer** node + `lib/prompts/discover-queries.ts` — smart-tier
  LLM call producing 4-8 natural-language queries + rationale; universal
  prompt (per-adapter translation) per spec §13.1; fan-out across
  providers via `dispatchSearch`; bulk persist via
  `createMany({ skipDuplicates: true })` for idempotency.
- **fetcher** node — bounded-concurrency-8 HEAD + GET + R2 upload +
  Mistral OCR + CorpusItem create; non-fatal skip for paywalled / 4xx /
  non-PDF / oversized; cross-reference cols populated.
- **screener** node + `lib/prompts/screen-paper.ts` — per-paper include
  / exclude verdict with relevanceScore + reason; persists
  `ScreeningDecision` rows; materializes `IncludedPaper` for the V1
  assessor when include=true AND the fetcher succeeded (so the assessor
  doesn't trip on null parsedMarkdown).
- **graph rewiring** — new conditional edge after `plan_gate`:
  `outbound`/`hybrid` projects route to `discoverer → discovery_gate →
  fetcher → screener → papers_gate`; `uploaded_only` keeps V1's
  `retriever → papers_gate` path. New `APPROVE_DISCOVERY` interrupt kind.
- **enum migration** `20260527200000_v2_status_and_checkpoint_kinds` —
  RunStatus += DISCOVERING / AWAITING_DISCOVERY_APPROVAL / FETCHING /
  SCREENING; CheckpointKind += APPROVE_DISCOVERY.
- **trigger task** — initial-state hydration now reads `project.searchScope`
  + `searchProviders`; setRunStatus branches APPROVE_DISCOVERY →
  AWAITING_DISCOVERY_APPROVAL.

**Key files:** `lib/agent/nodes/{discoverer,fetcher,screener}.ts`, `lib/agent/graph.ts`, `lib/agent/state.ts`, `lib/agent/runs.ts`, `trigger/run-review.ts`, `prisma/migrations/20260527200000_v2_status_and_checkpoint_kinds/`

## V2-M2 — Exa, UI, kill switch

**Goal:** Round out provider set + give users a way to actually use V2 +
operator panic-button.

**What shipped (m2a-m2d):**

- **Exa** adapter (`lib/search/providers/exa.ts`) — POST to
  `api.exa.ai/search` with semantic (`type: "neural"`) mode + bundled
  `contents.text` (free per-request pricing), x-api-key auth,
  startPublishedDate / endPublishedDate filters, PDF-URL detection for
  accessStatus.
- **SEARCH_DISABLED** kill switch in `lib/env.ts` — the discoverer node
  refuses to fan out when set to "1" (operator panic button pattern,
  same as DEMO_DISABLED).
- **EXA_API_KEY** env knob — Exa adapter throws SearchProviderError
  "missing API key" when unset; dispatcher records per-provider so other
  providers still contribute.
- **DiscoveryApprovalCard** (`components/runs/discovery-approval-card.tsx`)
  — client component renders queries + the deduped hit list with
  per-row keep/drop checkbox + reject-with-reason. Plugged into the
  run-detail page when an APPROVE_DISCOVERY checkpoint is PENDING.
- **NewProjectDialog** picks searchScope (uploaded_only / outbound /
  hybrid) + searchProviders. POST /api/projects accepts the new fields
  with safe defaults (outbound-without-providers coerces to
  ["openalex", "arxiv"]).
- **runs-start guard** relaxed: outbound mode skips the
  "≥1 PARSED corpus item" check (the discoverer builds the corpus
  itself); hybrid still requires uploads; both modes require ≥1
  search provider.

**Key files:** `lib/search/providers/exa.ts`, `lib/env.ts`, `lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.ts`, `components/runs/discovery-approval-card.tsx`, `components/projects/new-project-dialog.tsx`, `app/api/projects/route.ts`, `app/api/projects/[id]/runs/route.ts`

## V2-M3 — Eval metrics + schema field

**Goal:** Give the public `/evals` dashboard the same first-class
treatment for V2 nodes that V1 nodes get.

**What shipped:**

- `discoveryRecall(expected, discovered)` + `screeningPrecision(expected,
  admitted)` in `lib/eval/metrics.ts`, both honouring the existing
  vacuous-true convention.
- `expectedDois?: string[]` optional field added to
  `GoldenQuestionSchema` — existing v1 goldens stay valid (the field
  defaults to undefined → discoveryRecall returns 1 vacuously).

**Not yet shipped:** v2-mode golden YAMLs (with real arXiv DOIs) and the
EVAL_MODE=outbound CI path. These need careful research input from the
maintainer to pick goldens with verifiable arXiv IDs that aren't trivial
to surface. The framework is ready to consume them as soon as they land.

**Key files:** `lib/eval/metrics.ts`, `lib/eval/golden-schema.ts`

## V2-M6 — Cost-cap safety knobs (per-spec §7)

**Goal:** Implement the cost-cap knobs the v2 design promised so a
runaway outbound run can't blow the OCR + screener budget.

**What shipped:**

- `MAX_TOKENS_PER_RUN` default bumped 250k → 400k. V1 took ~150k for
  assessor/drafter/critic/cite_check; v2 adds discoverer + per-paper
  screener calls + OCR overhead. Per-env override unchanged.
- New `MAX_DISCOVERED_PAPERS_PER_RUN` env knob (default 50, ceiling
  100, Zod-validated). After dedup, the discoverer sorts by
  initialScore DESC and slices to `min(env_cap, project.searchMaxHits)`
  before persisting, so the fetcher loop never sees more than the
  configured ceiling. Per-project `searchMaxHits` (already on the
  Project model from M0) wins when tighter than the env cap; the env
  cap wins when the project asked for more (operator wins).
- `AgentState.searchMaxHits` added to plumb the per-project value;
  `trigger/run-review.ts` hydrates it alongside searchScope +
  searchProviders.

**Key files:** `lib/env.ts`, `lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.ts`, `lib/agent/state.ts`, `trigger/run-review.ts`, `tests/lib/agent/nodes/discoverer.test.ts`

## V2-M5 — MCP introspection for V2

**Goal:** Bring V2 capability into the MCP surface so external clients
(claude.ai, Cursor, Claude Desktop) can inspect outbound runs the same
way they inspect V1 reviews.

**What shipped:**

- `list_discovered_papers(reviewId)` — every paper the discoverer
  surfaced for an outbound run, plus per-paper fetch status + screener
  verdict + initial relevance score. Returns empty + searchScope hint
  for uploaded_only runs.
- `get_search_queries(reviewId)` — LLM-generated search queries
  (sourced from the APPROVE_DISCOVERY checkpoint's proposal),
  provider set, and per-provider error log from RunStep.
- Updated `tests/lib/mcp/tools-annotations.test.ts` + `mcp-route.test.ts`
  to assert the 5-tool surface.
- `docs/mcp/tools.md` + README MCP tool list updated.

**Key files:** `lib/mcp/tools/list-discovered-papers.ts`, `lib/mcp/tools/get-search-queries.ts`, `lib/mcp/tools/index.ts`, `tests/lib/mcp/tools/{list-discovered-papers,get-search-queries}.test.ts`, `docs/mcp/tools.md`

## V2-M4 — Docs sync + ceremony

**Goal:** Make the V2 capability legible to anyone landing in the README
+ cement the build narrative.

**What shipped:**

- README updated with the V2 mode overview ("Outbound search (v2, new)").
- README "What makes Thoth different" gets a new ribbon for outbound
  web search.
- Status row in the engineering-proofs table updated to mention v2.0.
- This roadmap doc (`thoth-v2-roadmap.md`) lands as the canonical
  shipping log.
- `thoth-v2-design.md` Status flipped from DRAFT to "Shipped".

## What stays deferred

Open V2-spec items that didn't ship in v2.0:

- **SearchQuery audit table.** The spec called for a per-call audit row
  capturing exact queries sent to each provider. The discoverer logs
  query strings + per-provider failures to RunStep.failureReason today,
  which is the on-disk audit. A dedicated table is easier to query but
  not load-bearing yet.
- **Real v2-mode goldens** + `EVAL_MODE=outbound` CI path. The metrics
  + schema field are wired; the YAMLs themselves need maintainer input.
- **Query-editing in the discovery_gate UI.** The first cut shows
  queries read-only and lets the user reject + re-plan if they're wrong.
  Edit-in-place is a v2.x UX upgrade.
