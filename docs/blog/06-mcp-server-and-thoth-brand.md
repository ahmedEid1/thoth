# Thoth, week six: an authenticated MCP server, and the ibis

*The sixth post in a series documenting an open-source agentic literature-review platform.*

## What I shipped

- A remote MCP server at `https://thoth-slr.vercel.app/api/mcp/mcp`, speaking Streamable HTTP (the current spec), with **three read-only tools** scoped to the authenticated user: `list_reviews`, `get_review_draft`, `get_citation_audit`.
- **OAuth 2.1 + PKCE + Dynamic Client Registration via Clerk** — Thoth is the OAuth Resource Server, Clerk is the Authorization Server (RFC 8707 + OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata). No manual token paste anywhere in the flow.
- A **per-call audit log** in `McpCall`, with the input payload stored only as a SHA-256 hash. The raw user input is never persisted.
- **DB-backed sliding-window rate limits** per `(userId, toolName)` — no external Redis required.
- A listing in the **official MCP Registry** as `io.github.ahmedEid1/thoth`, published via `mcp-publisher` against a `server.json` manifest.
- A **rebrand**: the project that had been "Atlas" for the first five milestones became **Thoth**, with a Delapouite ibis mark across the logo, the hero, the favicon, and a tightened editorial visual identity.
- An **anonymous demo flow** at `/demo` that provisions a Clerk guest user with an `@example.com` email and signs the visitor straight into an empty dashboard, so a recruiter can build their own review without creating an account.

This is the milestone where Thoth became the thing I'd been describing in interviews.

## Why MCP, and why authenticated

Most public MCP servers ship with no auth. The MCP Registry has thousands of entries; many of them expose an unauthenticated stdio binary or a public HTTPS endpoint that anyone can call. That's understandable for stateless demo tools, and a security liability for anything that touches user data.

Thoth's MCP server returns *the user's own reviews and per-citation audit reports*. There is no version of this that's safe to expose without auth. So the M5 design starts from the question: "how does a remote MCP client get a bearer token without me writing my own OAuth Authorization Server?"

The answer turned out to be cleaner than I expected, thanks to two pieces of recent industry work:

1. **The MCP spec's Resource Server pattern.** A modern MCP server doesn't have to be its own OAuth server. It declares itself a Resource Server, publishes a `oauth-protected-resource` metadata document at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`, and points clients at an external Authorization Server (Clerk, in my case). Clients discover the AS, do the OAuth dance there, come back with a bearer JWT, and the Resource Server validates the JWT against the AS's JWKS. RFC 8707 + OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata, both stable.
2. **Clerk's first-class MCP support.** `@clerk/mcp-tools` ships the helpers for the Resource Server pattern, including Dynamic Client Registration — the protocol that lets a brand-new MCP client (claude.ai, Cursor, MCP Inspector) register itself with Clerk on the fly. No manual client config, no per-client shared secret to distribute. The first time a user clicks "Connect to Thoth" in their MCP client, the client registers with Clerk, the user signs in to Clerk in their browser, Clerk issues a JWT, and the client has a bearer token. From the user's point of view: paste a URL, complete a browser sign-in, done.

The result is the demo I show in the README: a hiring manager pastes `https://thoth-slr.vercel.app/api/mcp/mcp` into claude.ai's custom connectors, signs in via Clerk in a popup, and calls `list_reviews` from inside a Claude conversation a few seconds later. End to end, no local install, no manual config.

## Three tools, read-only

The tool surface is small on purpose. M5's audience priority — locked during brainstorming — is **recruiter demo first**. A 3-tool surface ships in a day and a half; the original 6-tool design from the M1 spec would have taken three or four days and routed LLM cost onto recruiter traffic with no commensurate hiring upside.

The three tools:

- **`list_reviews`** — returns the authenticated user's runs with status, critic score, and faithfulness score. The entry point.
- **`get_review_draft`** — given a run id, returns the full markdown draft with inline `[paper_id]` citations.
- **`get_citation_audit`** — given a run id, returns the per-claim `cite_check` verdict report: every citation, its claim, the cited paper id, the supported/partially/not-supported verdict, the justification.

All three are read-only. All three are tenant-scoped — the Clerk-authenticated `userId` is the only way data flows back; there is no path to read another user's reviews. No tool exposes LLM calls on the request path, which means recruiter traffic doesn't burn the free-tier Mistral quota.

The three tools are also the demo. `list_reviews` surfaces a review with low faithfulness; `get_citation_audit` shows Claude.ai which claims weren't supported by the cited paper. The whole "we built `cite_check` for a reason" narrative is a 30-second interaction in a Claude conversation.

## The audit log

Every MCP tool call writes a row to `McpCall`:

- `userId`, `toolName`, `requestedAt`, `latencyMs`, `httpStatus`
- `inputHash` — the SHA-256 of the JSON-serialised input
- `outputSize` — the byte size of the response
- `errorMessage` if applicable

What's not stored: the raw input payload. Auditing "user X called `get_review_draft` 47 times in the last hour" is what matters; storing the raw input is data the service doesn't need and shouldn't hold. The hash is enough to detect identical retries (e.g. for the rate-limit logic to identify pathological clients) and to anchor an audit trail without ever holding sensitive content.

The rate limit reads the same table: per `(userId, toolName)` sliding window, computed by SQL aggregate over rows in the last N seconds. No Redis dependency — Postgres handles it at this scale, and one less moving part in the deploy is one less thing to break.

## The MCP Registry submission

The MCP ecosystem has a public registry — analogous to npm, but for MCP servers. Listing there is the way new clients discover servers. Submitting required:

1. A `server.json` manifest at the repo root declaring the server name (`io.github.ahmedEid1/thoth`), the supported transports, the endpoint URL, the OAuth metadata URL, and the tool list.
2. Publishing via `mcp-publisher` — a CLI that validates the manifest, signs the submission against the GitHub repo (proving I own the namespace), and submits it to the registry.
3. A registry review and approval.

The listing is verifiable from the public registry API:

```bash
curl "https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=thoth" | jq '.servers[0].server'
```

The status field is `active`. That's a third-party-verifiable proof on the README — anyone can run the curl and confirm.

## From Atlas to Thoth

The project shipped its first five milestones under the codename **Atlas**, which I'd picked because it was a placeholder I could live with for a few weeks. For the public surface — the production URL, the README, the social posts — the codename wasn't going to cut it. There are dozens of "Atlas"-something projects in the AI/data space; the name carries no signal.

The rebrand criteria were specific:

- A short, memorable proper noun.
- Symbolic fit with what the tool does (writing, scholarship, verification).
- Visual identity that doesn't lean on AI-stock-art (no neural networks, no purple-blue gradients, no robots).
- A logo I could ship as a single SVG without licensing risk.

**Thoth** — the ancient Egyptian ibis-headed god of writing, wisdom, and scribes — checked every box. The hieroglyph for "scribe" was literally an ibis. The name means "[he] is like the ibis." For a tool that drafts and verifies systematic literature reviews — the modern descendant of the work scribes did — the symbolic fit is direct.

The ibis mark is by [Delapouite](https://delapouite.com/), CC BY 3.0, via [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/1x1/delapouite/ibis.html). Single-color (Thoth blue, lapis lazuli `#1E3A8A`), papyrus gold as a quiet accent (`#C9A961`), no other ornamentation. The brand guide in [`docs/brand.md`](../brand.md) is explicit about what *not* to do: no papyrus textures, no hieroglyph dividers, no costume-party imagery. The brand carries via name and logo, not narrative.

All the production URLs moved to `thoth-slr.vercel.app`. The MCP registry slug is `io.github.ahmedEid1/thoth`. The git history still says Atlas in commits older than this milestone — I left that as-is, because rewriting history would have invalidated tags and broken external links.

## The anonymous demo flow

The other M5 surface that matters for the recruiter story is the anonymous demo. A hiring manager who's curious enough to click around the live app shouldn't have to fill out a sign-up form first.

The flow:

1. Visitor lands on `/`. Clicks "Try the demo."
2. `/api/demo/start` provisions a Clerk guest user with an `@example.com` email, returns a one-time handoff ticket.
3. The visitor is redirected to `/demo/handoff?ticket=...`, the only client component in the app. The client component exchanges the ticket for a Clerk session, signs the visitor into an empty dashboard.
4. From the visitor's point of view: click, half-second redirect, signed in, ready to build a review.

A guest cleanup task (`trigger/guest-cleanup.ts`, every 6 hours) drops guest accounts older than 24 hours along with their projects and corpus items. The free tier on Clerk + Neon + R2 stays within free-tier limits without manual gardening.

There's deliberately no pre-cloned sample data in the demo dashboard. I considered seeding it with a worked review of the ReAct paper so visitors could see the end state immediately, and decided against: the more interesting interaction is uploading a small PDF and watching the agent loop run. The recruiter's own paper, in the recruiter's own session, is more memorable than a canned demo on a paper they don't know.

## What's next: M6

The platform is built, the quality is measured, the interface is published. M6 is the **launch** milestone:

- A 30-question golden eval set drawn from real published Kitchenham reviews (replacing the 10-question synthetic v1).
- A one-page recruiter-targeted artefact linking to the live app, the public evals, the MCP demo, and the registry listing.
- Public surface: HN, LinkedIn, Twitter — timed to the recruiter pager going live.

The engineering work is mostly done. What's left is making the project legible to people who aren't going to read the codebase — which is its own discipline, and the one that makes the difference between a portfolio repo and a job offer.
